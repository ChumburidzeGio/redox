# Driving licence
If you plan to stay long-term in the Netherlands, it is often worth exchanging your foreign driving licence for a Dutch rijbewijs. 

- If you are an EU/EEA citizen and your licence was issued before January 19, 2013, then you can drive with your licence for 10 years after it was issued. (if it is issued after January 19, 2013, you can drive with it for up to 15 years.)

- For all other non-EU countries licences are valid for 185 days from the date you register at your local municipality. You will need to exchange your licence within that first six month period. 

If you apply for a Dutch driving licence after the 185 days, you will need to take the Dutch driving exams.(unless you benefid the 30% tax ruling) 

**You can exchange your driver license if:** 

- You live in the Netherlands and are registered with your local municipality with a valid residen permit (unless you are citizen of the EU, EEA or Switzerland) 

- You are from the EU/EEA, Switzerland OR are from a country with a special agreement OR you receive the 30% tax ruling 

- Your current driving licence is valid

- You obtained your current driving licence while being a resident of that country for at least half a year (185 days) 

If you meet the above conditions for exchanging your driving licence, you will need to apply at Amsterdam municipality. They will forward your exchange application to the Road Transportation Authority (RDW). For the application, you need valid identity documents such as a **passport, your residence permit unless you are a citizen of the EU/EEA or Switzerland, proof of 30% tax ruling, your foreign driving licence, your BSN and a photo.**

You may also be asked for a certificate of fitness or VvG (verklaring van geschiktheid) to prove you are physically and psychologically fit to drive. You can get the VvG form your municipality, at Mijn CBR (log in with your DigiD) or from certain expat centres.

  If you do not meet these conditions, you cannot directly exchange your licence for a Dutch one. This means you will need to take a standard theory and practical test at the Central Office for Motor Vehicle Driver Testing (CBR).
