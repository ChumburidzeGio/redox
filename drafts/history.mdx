The 17th century is known as the Dutch Golden Age, which revolved around flourishing Amsterdam. At this time artists such as Rembrandt led a cultural renaissance in the city whilst Dutch ships sailed all over the world, bringing back exotic and highly valued products such as spices and silk. The end of the Golden Age was signaled in 1672 when the Netherlands was attacked by pretty much all of its neighbors, France, England, and two German states combined.

France invaded the Netherlands again in 1795, led by Napoleon and Nazis in 1940. The 60 years following the war saw Amsterdam change immensely. It moved from being a trade city to a service-based city and became a lot more liberally minded following the fascism of WWII. There was a clean-up of the police force, and several liberalization movements from the 1960s through to the 1980s had a big impact. Amsterdam also became renowned for its tolerance to soft drug use. This remains the case today, although the Dutch combine it with their traditional business acumen and sense, and have managed to turn it into a thriving industry.
