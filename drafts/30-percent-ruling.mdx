# 30% ruling 
If your situation meets necessary conditions when you come to the Netherlands as a highly-skilled migrant, you can benefit from a 30% ruling. 

It means your employer can pay 30% of your salary as a tax-free allowance. So your salary will reduce by 30%, and in return, you should receive a 30% allowance as reimbursement for expenses which is not subject to income tax. 

**To be eligible for the 30% ruling:**

1. You must be transferred or recruited from abroad

2. You should be working for an employer registered with the Dutch tax office and paying Dutch payroll tax.

3. You have to agree with your employer in writing that the  30% ruling is applicable.

4. You need to prove that you did not reside within 150km from the Dutch border for the last 18 out of 24 months at the time of hiring;

5. Your salary meets the minimum requirements.(the annual taxable salary for an employee cannot be less than €38,961 but €29,616 is applicable for those who have completed a Master's degree and are younger than 30 years old.) 

6. You need to have expertise that is scarcely available in the Netherlands.

**Examples of 30% ruling:**
You are 35 years old and you receive a salary of €100,000. You meet the minimum salary requirement to receive the full 30% ruling. After taking into account the 30% ruling your taxable salary will be €70,000. In addition, you receive a tax free allowance of €30,000. 

Your salary is €40,000; reducing it by 30% brings it down to €28,000. This would take it below the minimum threshold. You would therefore only be able to accept a reimbursement that brings your salary down to the threshold. You would still benefit from the 30% ruling, but not for the full amount.
