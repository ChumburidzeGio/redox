# 30% ruling 
If your situation meets necessary conditions when you come to the Netherlands as a highly-skilled migrant, you can benefit from a 30% ruling. 

It means your employer can pay 30% of your salary as a tax-free allowance. So your salary will reduce by 30%, and in return, you should receive a 30% allowance as reimbursement for expenses which is not subject to income tax. 

**You could be eligible for the 30% ruling if:** 

- You transferred or recruited from abroad.

- You work for an employer registered with the Dutch tax office and paying Dutch payroll tax.

- You agree with your employer in writing that the 30% ruling is applicable.

- You could prove that you did not reside within 150km from the Dutch border for the last 18 out of 24 months at the time of hiring. 

- Your salary meets the minimum requirements. (the annual taxable wage for an employee cannot be less than €38,961, but €29,616 is applicable for those who have completed a Master's degree and are younger than 30 years old.) 

**Examples of 30% ruling:**

You are 35 years old, and you receive a salary of €100,000. Therefore, you meet the minimum salary requirement to receive the full 30% ruling. After taking the 30% rule into account, your taxable salary will be €70,000. In addition, you receive a tax-free allowance of €30,000.

Your salary is €40,000; reducing it by 30% brings it down to €28,000. This would take it below the minimum threshold. Therefore, you would only be able to accept a reimbursement that brings your salary down to the threshold. You would still benefit from the 30% ruling, but not for the total amount.
