# Bicycle
Biking is the main and the cheapest mode of transport in the Netherlands.

### Where to get it?
Most Amsterdammers ride reasonably basic bicycles, preferring not to subject an expensive bike as it might get stolen. 

If you prefer to get a new bike, you can go to **bicycle shops**, but they are usually more expensive and starts at €250. But it is also possible to pay around 120-250€ at a bicycle shop and buy a second-hand bike. Online shops like **Marktplaats** or some Facebook groups might be alternatives to bicycle shops for second-hand bikes.

    If you buy a bike online from a private seller or on the street, be aware that it can be stolen and get you into trouble because buying a stolen bike is a criminal offense. Always buy it from bicycle stores and request a receipt. Also, keep your bike serial number to report it to the police if it gets stolen.

If you don't want to buy a bike, subscription bikes are another affordable option. It takes away all the hassle and headache of searching, buying, and maintaining a bike of your own. The most popular one is **Swapfiets**, for more information you can check [their website](https://swapfiets.nl/en-NL).

<Callout warning>
    Always chain your bike on something and buy a good chain whether you choose to buy a second-hand or brand new bike, as bicycle theft is common in Amsterdam.
