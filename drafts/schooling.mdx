In every country, the schooling system may differ. The Dutch school system's structure is also different from other countries, which can be confusing for newcomers. Therefore, your kids can find it tough to adjust to the school system in the Netherlands.

We help you to make the transition as easy as possible for your children when it comes to finding a suitable school in the Netherlands for them.
Before we start searching schools for your children, we have a call with you to know your preferences and expectations from your kids' school. For example, it is crucial to decide if you want your kids to go to a Dutch or international school. 

Knowing which city/neighborhood you would like to live in is also essential because some schools might not have spots for your children. 
Once we know where you will be living and your preferences, we contact the schools to learn about their process for admission because some schools follow different procedures. We also check if they have spots for your children at the time of your relocation.

Depending on your kids' age, they might have to go to newcomers' class to learn the Dutch language before they can continue in Dutch schools. If your children need to go to the language school, we make sure we contact them about those classes. The schools usually send their intake forms to parents before enrolling the children. While you sign these forms, you also need to state your address in the Netherlands. 

We hand the forms you filled to the schools and schedule digital meetings with them so you can ask all your questions regarding their education system. We make sure we present during these meetings to provide the help you need. 

If the schools have available spots in your children's age groups, your children can enroll l the schools after all the meetings, and administrative procedures are completed. 

## The Dutch school system

<Callout>
  Before going into details, keep in mind that education is compulsory (leerplicht) in the Netherlands from the ages of five to 16, however, most children start to attend primary school at age four and they transfer to secondary school after eight years.

**Dutch day care, crèche, kindergarten (kinderopvang, kinderdagverblijf, peuterspeelzaal)**

Until the age of five, infants and young children in the Netherlands can attend a variety of non-compulsory daycare educational options such as crèche, kindergarten or childminding.

**Primary Schools (basisonderwijs)**

Primary school has eight grades, ranging from **Groep 1** (4-year olds) to **Groep 8** (12-year olds). It is not compulsory to attend primary school until Groep 2, at age five, but most children begin in Groep 1 already at the age of four.

Students attend primary school for eight years, until they are 12, where they gain basic skills such as reading, writing and arithmetic. They will also start studying English by the time they reach Group 7, if not before then. 

- **Ages 4 and 5:** The children in this year are called kleuters, and the focus is on learning through play, social skills, structure, and gradual preparation for reading and writing.
- **Ages 6 to 12:** Formal reading and writing start from age 6. Most primary schools do not focus heavily on homework (a maximum of 30 minutes per week is assigned on average).  

**Secondary Schools (voortgezet onderwijs)** 

When they start secondary school (middelbare school) at age 12, children enter one of three different streams for their secondary education. The different streams represent different educational paths, based on a student’s academic level and interests:

- **VMBO (preparatory secondary vocational education):** The VMBO is a four-year vocationally-orientated stream focussed on practical knowledge, which leads to vocational training (MBO). It has two qualification levels and students complete the track at the age of 16.

- **HAVO (senior general secondary education):** The HAVO is a five-year middle stream that prepares students to study higher professional education at universities of applied sciences (hogescholen), where they can follow a bachelor’s degree in applied sciences (HBO). Students complete the HAVO around the age of 17.

- **VWO (pre-university education):** The VWO is a six-year education stream with a focus on theoretical knowledge, that prepares students to follow a bachelor’s degree (WO) at a research university. Students study the VWO at schools known as atheneum and gymnasium and complete the stream around the age of 18.

**Tips:** You can visit the ‘Scholen op de Kaart’ website [www.scholenopdekaart.nl](https://scholenopdekaart.nl/) and enter your postcode to see a list of schools in your area and tick **‘basisschool’** for primary and **‘middelbare school’** for secondary schools.

## International Schools
Many international schools offer an international curriculum at primary and/or secondary levels. Some are subsidised by the government, and others are private. 

All international schools can explain their education options in person, by phone, or online, and they recommend visiting where possible so that you can get a complete sense of their facilities and offerings. Some international schools in Amsterdam are **Amity International School, Amsterdam International Community School, British School of Amsterdam** and **Int'l School of Amsterdam.** There are also international schools in Amstelveen and Almere such as **Amstelland International School, International school Almere, and Int'l Primary School Almere.** 

## Newcomers' class 
International children under age of 6 can go straight into Dutch primary education even if they don’t speak Dutch. Children that are aged between six and 12 years old, are new to the Netherlands and don't speak Dutch join so-called newcomers' classes. These schools are called **Taalcentrum/Taalklas** and focus on learning Dutch and acquaint the children with Dutch culture to continue in regular Dutch or bilingual education after one year. There are no additional costs for attending a newcomers' class.

Children aged 12 and above go to an international bridging class called **Internationale Schakelklas (ISK).** After enrolment, the child will be tested by the school so they can start out at the appropriate level. Students stay in the ISK for approximately one or two years and can enrol at any time of the year, but must be present for enrolment.
