This is the knowledge base of Relocify containing all the information necessary for our clients. All the content lives under `pages` folder and each file that ends with `.mdx` represents page on the website, for example `pages/amsterdam/districts.mdx` is the page accessible under `/amsterdam/districts`.

For formatting the text you have to use markdown syntax, here are all the elements you can use:

# Text formatting
To create a heading, add number signs (`#`) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (`<h3>`), use three number signs (e.g., `### My Header`).

To add titles to pages use `# Heading level 1`, for titles to separate sections use `## Heading level 2`  and for subsections (to title section inside another section) use `### Heading level 3`.

## Best practices

Always put space after `#` and add new lines before and after the header.
