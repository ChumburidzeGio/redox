International children under the age of 6 can go straight into Dutch primary education even if they don't speak Dutch. However, children between six and 12 years old who are new to the Netherlands and don't speak Dutch join **newcomers' classes.** These schools are called **Taalcentrum/Taalklas** and focus on learning Dutch and acquaint the children with Dutch culture to continue in regular Dutch or bilingual education after one year.
