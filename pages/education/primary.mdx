# Primary education
Primary education is intended for children in the **age group 4 to 12** and is compulsory for children from the age of 5. Children gain basic reading, writing, and arithmetic skills in primary school.

If you are already in the Netherlands around your childâ€™s third birthday, the municipality of Amsterdam will send you a primary school application and a brochure explaining the admission policy. Then you can choose the school you want your child to attend.   

International children under the age of 6 can go straight into Dutch primary education even if they don't speak Dutch. However, children between six and 12 years old who are new to the Netherlands and don't speak Dutch join **newcomers' classes.** These schools are called **Taalcentrum/Taalklas** and focus on learning Dutch and acquaint the children with Dutch culture to continue in regular Dutch or bilingual education after one year.

## Bilingual primary education
There are also some bilingual primary schools in the Netherlands. Children are taught in English at these schools for 30% to 50% of the day, from age 4. Core subjects are taught in Dutch, while other topics, including social, motor and creative development are taught in English.

[The Visserschool](https://devisserschool.nl/home-eng/) is the only primary school in Amsterdam to offer bilingual primary education (TPO) for kids from four to twelve years old. To see the other bilingual primary schools in different cities, you can visit [Nuffic](https://www.nuffic.nl/onderwerpen/tweetalig-primair-onderwijs/tweetalige-basisscholen).
