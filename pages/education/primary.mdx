If you are already in the Netherlands around your childâ€™s third birthday, the municipality of Amsterdam will send you a primary school application and a brochure explaining admission policy. You can register your child by submitting this application form to the school of your first preference.

International children under the age of 6 can go straight into Dutch primary education even if they don't speak Dutch. However, children between six and 12 years old who are new to the Netherlands and don't speak Dutch join **newcomers' classes.** These schools are called **Taalcentrum/Taalklas** and focus on learning Dutch and acquaint the children with Dutch culture to continue in regular Dutch or bilingual education after one year.

## Billingual primary education
There are also some bilingual primary school in the Netherlands. The official languages are English and Dutch. At these schools children are taught in English for 30% to 50% of the day, from age 4. 

**The Visserschool** is the only primary school in Amsterdam to offer bilingual primary education (TPO) for kids from four to twelve years old.
