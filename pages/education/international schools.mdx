# International Schools
If you plan to stay in the Netherlands temporarily, you might think of sending your children to an international school. In that way, when you move to another place, they can continue to the international curriculum.

Many international schools in the Netherlands offer an international curriculum at primary and secondary levels. However, the content of their curriculum changes depending on the school your children will attend. 

Keep in mind that if your children go to an international school at a secondary level, it can be difficult to continue their higher education here because not all universities have English bachelor’s programs.

The government subsidizes some international schools, and the others are private. 

- **Dutch international schools** are for children who live temporarily (2 to 3 years) in the country because of their parents’ jobs. The annual fees for these schools are around €3,600–6,000 euros, and many schools have a waiting list. 

- **Private international** schools have higher fees, such as €12,000–24,000 euros. However, these schools usually have shorter waiting lists and offer more facilities and after-school activities. 

Some known international schools in Amsterdam are **Amity International School, Amsterdam International Community School, British School of Amsterdam** and **Int'l School of Amsterdam.** There are also international schools in Amstelveen and Almere such as **Amstelland International School, **Hermann Wesselink College, International School Almere, and Int'l Primary School Almere.** 

All international schools can explain their education options in person, by phone, or online, and they recommend visiting where possible so that you can get a sense of their facilities and offerings.
