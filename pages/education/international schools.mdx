# International Schools
Many international schools offer an international curriculum at primary and secondary levels. However, their curriculum changes depending on the school your children will attend. 

The government subsidizes some international schools, and the others are private. The subsidized international schools are for children who live temporarily (2 to 3 years) in the country because of their parents’ jobs. The annual fees for these schools are around €3,600–6,000 euros per year, and many schools have a waiting list.

Private international schools have higher fees, such as €12,000–24,000 euros. However, these schools usually have shorter waiting lists and offer more facilities and after-school activities. 

Some private international schools in Amsterdam are **Amity International School, Amsterdam International Community School, British School of Amsterdam** and **Int'l School of Amsterdam.** There are also international schools in Amstelveen and Almere such as **Amstelland International School, International school Almere, and Int'l Primary School Almere.** 

All international schools can explain their education options in person, by phone, or online, and they recommend visiting where possible so that you can get a sense of their facilities and offerings.
