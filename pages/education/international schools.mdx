# International Schools
If you plan to stay in the Netherlands temporarily, you might think of sending your children to an international school. In that way, when you move on to another place, the international curriculum continues.

Many international schools offer an international curriculum at primary and secondary levels. However, the content of their curriculum changes depending on the school your children will attend. Suppose your children go to an international school at a secondary level. In that case, it can be a bit difficult when they want to continue their higher education here because all universities have English bachelor’s programs. 

The government subsidizes some international schools, and the others are private. 

- **Dutch international schools** are for children who live temporarily (2 to 3 years) in the country because of their parents’ jobs. The annual fees for these schools are around €3,600–6,000 euros per year, and many schools have a waiting list. 

- **Private international** schools have higher fees, such as €12,000–24,000 euros. However, these schools usually have shorter waiting lists and offer more facilities and after-school activities. 

Some international schools in Amsterdam are **Amity International School, Amsterdam International Community School, British School of Amsterdam** and **Int'l School of Amsterdam.** There are also international schools in Amstelveen and Almere such as **Amstelland International School, International school Almere, and Int'l Primary School Almere.** 

All international schools can explain their education options in person, by phone, or online, and they recommend visiting where possible so that you can get a sense of their facilities and offerings.
