# Secondary education

At the age of 12 children go to one of the following types of secondary education:

- **VMBO (preparatory secondary vocational education):** The VMBO is a **four-year** vocationally-orientated stream focussed on practical knowledge, which leads to vocational training (MBO). It has two qualification levels and students complete the track at the age of 16.

- **HAVO (senior general secondary education):** The HAVO is a **five-year** middle stream that prepares students to study higher professional education at universities of applied sciences (hogescholen), where they can follow a bachelor’s degree in applied sciences (HBO). Students complete the HAVO around the age of 17.

- **VWO (pre-university education):** The VWO is a **six-year** education stream with a focus on theoretical knowledge, that prepares students to follow a bachelor’s degree (WO) at a research university. Students study the VWO at schools known as atheneum and gymnasium and complete the stream around the age of 18.

International children aged 12 and above go to an international bridging class called **Internationale Schakelklas (ISK).** Students stay in the ISK for approximately one or two years depending on their level, and the school will test them. Once they finish the ISK, they can start at the appropriate secondary school level.

## Bilingual secondary education

In bilingual secondary schools, at least 50% of the subjects are taught in English. The children speak English during for instance geography or history lessons, or during physical education.

On the other hand, the schools still follow the Dutch curriculum so almost half of the subjects are in Dutch and the children need to take the Dutch school-leaving exams. 

## International Schools

Many international schools offer an international curriculum at primary and/or secondary levels. However, their curriculum changes depending on the school your children will attend. 

The government subsidizes some international schools, and the others are private. The subsidized international schools are intended for children who live temporarily (2 to 3 years) in the country because of their parents’ jobs. The fees for these schools are around 4,500 to 5,500 euros per year and many schools have a waiting list.

On the other hand, the private international schools are generally more expensive but they usually have shorter waiting lists, and tend to offer more facilities, and after-school activities.

Some international schools in Amsterdam are **Amity International School, Amsterdam International Community School, British School of Amsterdam** and **Int'l School of Amsterdam.** There are also international schools in Amstelveen and Almere such as **Amstelland International School, International school Almere, and Int'l Primary School Almere.** 

All international schools can explain their education options in person, by phone, or online, and they recommend visiting where possible so that you can get a sense of their facilities and offerings.
