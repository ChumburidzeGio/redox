# Utilities
In the Netherlands, regional companies are responsible for the energy transportation (electricity and gas), and it is possible to choose your energy supplier from comparison websites like [Pricewise](https://www.pricewise.nl/energie-vergelijken/) or [Independer](https://www.independer.nl/energie/info/besparen/energieverbruik-berekenen).

In most cases, the utilities (gas, water, and electricity) will already be available in your apartment, and you will have to transfer accounts to your name.

## Electricity
Things to consider when looking for electricity providers: For the usage, there is "Stroom normal," this is during the day, and "Stroom dal," at night. You can specify 900 for "Stroom normal" for two people (on the website, the default is 1250 - this is a lot) and 500 for "Stroom dal."

You pay a monthly installment based on expected annual energy costs. These installments are paid directly to the energy supplier of your choice. Keep in mind the amount you pay each month is not necessarily the actual cost. If you use more electricity than indicated, you will have to pay extra at the end of the year; if less, the difference will be refunded after the supplier has calculated the final amount. 

## Water
Although you can choose your energy provider, you cannot choose your water supplier. Each city has its provider - in Amsterdam, it is Waternet - you can register on [their website](https://www.waternet.nl/en/service-and-contact/moving-home/register/#/).

In addition to the cost of water itself, Waternet will also send a tax bill to everyone registered in the municipal register (bevolkingsregister). This bill includes a waste water purification tax (zuiveringsheffing) and a maintenance fee for the dykes and the water level. 

## Internet
Many Internet providers in the Netherlands offer Internet via cable, ADSL/VDSL, and fiber optics, which may be determined by where you live. Signing up is easy and usually done online or via the phone. Prices vary depending on the provider and what package you go for; generally, the faster the Internet, the higher the cost.

## Municipal taxes
For all tenants within the Amsterdam region, two municipal taxes apply. In principle, these amounts are paid directly to Waternet/ the municipality by the tenant.

**Water authority tax**: As a tenant, you pay for the purification of water. Tenants receive a tax assessment from Waternet. For more information, visit [here](https://www.waternet.nl/en/service-and-contact/water-authority-tax/)

**Waste collection tax**: The tenant pays this tax to the municipality for the collection and processing of household waste. This tax is calculated on the basis of the number of people living in the rented property and the location of the property.
