# Utilities

## Gas & Electricity
In the Netherlands, regional companies are responsible for energy transportation. Gas and electricity are both supplied by the same provider. It is possible to choose your energy supplier from comparison websites like [Pricewise](https://www.pricewise.nl/energie-vergelijken/) or [Independer](https://www.independer.nl/energie/info/besparen/energieverbruik-berekenen).

Things to consider when looking for electricity providers: For the usage, there is "Stroom normal," this is during the day, and "Stroom dal," at night. You can specify 900 for "Stroom normal" for two people (on the website, the default is 1250 - this is a lot) and 500 for "Stroom dal."

For the gas: you can set 1000 m3 per year for a couple.

In most cases, gas & electricity will already be available in your apartment, and you will have to transfer accounts to your name. However, the power is switched off when the previous occupants close their account. Therefore, it is crucial to quickly arrange gas and electricity in your new apartment. Note the meter reading and notify the energy supplier if you don't want to change the current energy provider in the apartment. 

Once you have your gas & electricity, you pay monthly installments directly to your energy supplier based on expected annual energy costs. Occasionally, in short-term, furnished apartments landlord will pay energy costs on your behalf.

  Keep in mind the amount you pay each month is not necessarily the actual cost. For example, if you use more electricity than indicated, you will have to pay extra at the end of the year; if less, the difference will be refunded after the supplier has calculated the final amount.

## Water
Most accommodation is already connected to the water supply of drinking water provider. Although you can choose your energy provider, you cannot choose your water supplier. Each city has its provider - in Amsterdam, it is Waternet - you can register on [their website](https://www.waternet.nl/en/service-and-contact/moving-home/register/#/). The water can be used immediately and the water meter in your apartment measures consumption. 

## Internet
Many Internet providers in the Netherlands offer Internet via cable, ADSL/VDSL, and fiber optics, which may be determined by where you live. Signing up is easy and usually done online or via the phone. Prices vary depending on the provider and what package you go for; generally, the faster the Internet, the higher the cost.

## Mobile Phone
You can choose between a contract (Abonnementen) or a prepaid card. 

Prepaid card providers offer cheap packages including the option to keep the same number without charge. On the other hand, it would be wiser to sign a contract if you use your phone for national calls.

## Municipal Taxes
For all tenants within the Amsterdam region, two municipal taxes apply. In principle, these amounts are directly paid by the tenant to Waternet and the municipality.

**Water authority tax**: As a tenant, you pay for the purification of water. Tenants receive a tax assessment from Waternet. For more information, visit [here](https://www.waternet.nl/en/service-and-contact/water-authority-tax/).

**Waste collection tax**: The tenant pays this tax to the municipality for the collection and processing of household waste. This tax is calculated on the basis of the number of people living in the rented property and the location of the property.
