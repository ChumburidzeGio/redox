# Obtaining BSN

Everyone living in the Netherlands must have a citizen service number, often referred to as a BSN (burgerservicenummer). You’ll need one to work, receive your salary, open a bank account, arrange health insurance, visit a doctor or hospital, or apply for benefits. In addition, if you leave the Netherlands and later return, you’ll keep the same citizen service number when you re-register with the municipality.

We will schedule a BSN appointment for you as soon as we start your relocation process. Once we have your appointment, we will send you the confirmation email, including the necessary documents you will have to bring. 

Keep in mind that the appointment date can be later than when you arrive in the Netherlands due to overload work at the IN Amsterdam office. You will have to go to IN Amsterdam office to receive your BSN number with the documents mentioned.
