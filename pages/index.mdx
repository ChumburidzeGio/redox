### About Relocify
Relocify helps new hires in Dutch startups with all immigration and relocation matters. We believe that borders or visas should not limit opportunities for talented people and that moving to a new country should be fun and exciting.

Unfortunately, today, a few companies provide relocation services to employees and only to those with high-demand skills. We want to make it universally accessible so that any employee can have a fun and stress-free relocation experience to the new country despite their seniority or company size.
