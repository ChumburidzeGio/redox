# Getting started
Welcome to Redox, it's our wiki where you will find all the information you will need on the way to Amsterdam.

### About Relocify
Relocify helps new hires in Dutch startups with all immigration and relocation matters. We believe that borders or visas should not limit opportunities for talented people and that moving to a new country should be fun and exciting.

Unfortunately, today, a few companies provide relocation services to employees and only to those with high-demand skills. We want to make it universally accessible so that any employee can have a fun and stress-free relocation experience to the new country despite their seniority or company size.

### First steps
To start the relocation process we will invite you to [our app](https://relocify.relocationonline.com/), where you will find all the necessary information about the process. Please use Redox to learn more about Amsterdam and all the steps during the relocation process.

Once you're on board, we will need certain documents from you, such as a copy of your passport and your employment contract. In addition, if you are relocating with your partner or family, we also need their documents. 

When we request these documents, you can upload the necessary documents to the “add document” section.
