# Money Transfer 
Before you start living in the Netherlands, you might need to transfer money to a Dutch bank account for some reason, such as renting an apartment, paying for a deposit, etc. Also, when you start living in the Netherlands, you will likely end up transferring money from your bank account to your Dutch bank account or the other way around. 

## Online transfer
You can transfer money with traditional banks. However, traditional banks often charge high fees. Therefore, online money transfer is becoming more and more popular. It is fast, secure and it does not cost a lot. 

Online money transfer services save you also time. You don't have to visit your bank in person. Instead, you can use your laptop or phone and wire the money using your preferred online money transfer service.
