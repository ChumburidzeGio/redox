# Money Transfer 
Before you start living in the Netherlands, you might need to transfer money to a Dutch bank account for some reason, such as renting an apartment, paying for a deposit, etc. Also, when you start living in the Netherlands, you will likely end up transferring money from your bank account to your Dutch bank account or the other way around. 

The Dutch Central Bank (DNB) is responsible for secure and reliable payment systems, including money transfers in the Netherlands. Dutch law requires all means of payment to meet the regulations for the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).

You can make and receive euro payments across the European Union (EU) as quickly as transactions are made currently within national borders, using **IBAN** (International Bank Account Number). In this case, the payment or international money transfer will not generally incur an additional cost. 

However, if you transfer money to a SEPA country that does not use the euro as its currency, you might pay more due to the exchange rate. You will probably need to pay a fee to make an international money transfer to a non-SEPA country. 

## Online transfer
You can transfer money with traditional banks. However, traditional banks often charge high fees. Therefore, online money transfer is becoming more and more popular. It is fast, secure and it does not cost a lot. 

Online money transfer services save you also time. You don't have to visit your bank in person. Instead, you can use your laptop or phone and wire the money using your preferred online money transfer service. 

You have a number of options in the Netherlands for making an international money transfer.
