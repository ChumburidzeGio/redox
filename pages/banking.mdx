# Banking
## Methods of payment (Offline)
In the Netherlands, payment is usually made by debit card (pinpas) – a card that takes money directly from your (Dutch) bank account or occasionally with cash. Some places that are more tourist-friendly, including hotels, restaurants, bars, and grocery stores in the city centre accept also credit cards, though most other places only accept debit cards or cash due to high fees from the credit card issuers.

## Payments online
For online payments generally, iDEAL is used, which transfers money directly from your (Dutch) bank account to the recipient's (Dutch) bank account so there are no transfer fees involved, even though transfers are immediate. For personal transfers iDeal is used as well, you go to your bank's mobile app, create a sharable link for iDeal payment or create a QR code that another person can scan to send you funds directly from their bank account.

    Using iDEAL can be problematic when you need a refund. Because handling refunds is not part of the iDEAL scheme so contacting the seller about the refund would be your only option. However, if you've paid with a credit card, you can also reach your bank.
