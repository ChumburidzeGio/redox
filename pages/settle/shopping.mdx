# Dutch supermarkets and grocery stores
## Dutch supermarket chains 
  
**Albert Heijn**(https://www.ah.nl/)is the most known supermarket with good food quality but it is also the most expensive. **Jumbo**, **Plus**, and **Dirk** are good options if you want more affordable supermarkets. There are even cheaper alternatives like **Lidl** and **Aldi** but lower quality. Also, some supermarkets are known for vegan, organic, and gluten-free products, such as **Marqt** and **Ekoplaza.**

    Some supermarkets, including Albert Heijn, don't accept Visa or Mastercard credit cards. Instead, you'll need cash or a Dutch bank account, which will provide you with a Maestro or V-Pay card that can be used everywhere. And, if you don't want to pay for shopping bags, you should bring your bag from home.

## Online grocery services / food delivery 
If you cannot get to the supermarket in person or prefer home delivery, you’re in luck. Dutch supermarkets offer home delivery services, including Albert Heijn and Jumbo. You can also order online-only supermarkets and grocery stores, such as **Picnic, Groente Broer, Getir.**  

If you are not in the mood for cooking, you’ll find many takeout options for all tastes in your city. The most popular delivery platforms operating in the Netherlands are **Thuisbezorgd** and **UberEats**. 

You can download their apps, and these platforms will connect you with takeaways and restaurants in your neighborhood. You might need to pay for the food when you order, so ensure you provide your credit card details unless you can pay on delivery.
