# Language 
Although almost everyone can speak English, especially in Amsterdam, understanding Dutch makes it easier to communicate with people around you. There are various websites and learning courses where you can start practicing Dutch. Duolingo is an example of a language app for people looking to learn a new language. 

Also, most municipalities offer Dutch courses for non-Dutch speakers. You can also go to meetups and practice Dutch with a Dutch person who wants to learn your native language.

<Callout>
  There is no law that says employees must be given a day off work on certain public holidays. So no one has a legal right to a day off on a public holiday. Your collective labour agreement or employment contract will tell you if you have the day off on public holidays.
