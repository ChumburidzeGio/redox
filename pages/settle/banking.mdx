## Methods of payment (Offline)
In the Netherlands, payment is usually made by debit card (pinpas) â€“ a card that takes money directly from your (Dutch) bank account or occasionally with cash. Some places that are more tourist-friendly, including hotels, restaurants, and bars accept also credit cards, though most other places only accept debit cards or cash due to high fees from the credit card issuers.

## Payments online
For online payments generally, iDEAL is used, which transfers money directly from your (Dutch) bank account to the recipient's (Dutch) bank account so there are no transfer fees involved, even though transfers are immediate. Some online stores also accept credit cards but they mostly charge an extra fee for it. For personal transfers iDeal is used as well, you go to your bank's mobile app, create a sharable link for iDeal payment or create a QR code that another person can scan to send you funds directly from their bank account.

Although using Ideal is very handy, you should keep in mind that it can be problematic when you need a refund. If you've paid with a credit card and your purchase has gone wrong, you may be entitled to ask for a refund. Your first step should always be to contact the seller, but if you're unable to resolve the situation to your satisfaction, your card provider may still be able to help you. Handling refunds is not part of the iDEAL scheme, so contacting the seller about the refund would be your only option.  

## Opening bank account
To receive your salary and pay expenses you need to open a bank account. The most popular banks among expats are [ABN Amro](https://www.abnamro.nl/en/personal/index.html), [ING](https://www.ing.nl/particulier/index.html) and [Bunq](https://www.bunq.com/). We usually open accounts in ABN Amro as it has a [special program](https://www.abnamro.nl/en/personal/payments/open-an-account/make-appointment.html) for expats.

To open a private bank account in the Netherlands you will need to either make an appointment online, or simply walk into your nearest branch with all of your details. You will need to have your BSN number (Burgerservicenummer),  your passport or ID, your rental contract and residency permit with you. Once all the details have been processed you will have to simply wait until your account is approved and your new pinpas is sent out to you.


## Splitting bills
In the Netherlands, it's generally accepted to split bills even if you go out to the bar with your friends. Generally, iDeal is used for these purposes which is available in all dutch mobile banking apps or you can download the app [Tikkie](https://www.tikkie.me/). If you go for holidays in group [SplitWise](https://www.splitwise.com/) is a popular app for splitting bills.
