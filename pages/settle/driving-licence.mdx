# Driving licence
New expats can continue to use their foreign driving licence for a certain period after they arrive in the Netherlands. The length of licence validity can vary greatly - from six months up to 15 years - depending on the country of issue. 

If you are an EU/EEA citizen and your licence was issued before January 19, 2013, then you can drive on that licence for 10 years after it was issued. (if your  licence issued after January 19, 2013, you can drive with it for up to 15 years.)

For all other countries (including the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba) licences are valid for six months from the date you register at your local municipality.

## Exchanging your licence
You can exchange your licence for a Dutch one if you meet **ALL** of the following conditions:

- You live in the Netherlands and are registered with your local municipality

- You are from the EU/EEA, Switzerland OR are from a country with a special agreement OR you receive the 30% tax ruling

- You have a valid residence permit (unless you are a citizen of the EU, EEA or Switzerland)

- Your current driving licence is valid

- Your current driving licence, if issued in a country outside the EU, was issued after being a resident of that country for at least 185 days

If you meet the above conditions for exchanging your driving licence, you must submit your application at your local City Office (stadsloket) with **colour passport photograph, your foreign driving licence, your residence permit unless you are a citizen of the EU/EEA or Switzerland, proof of 30% tax ruling (if applicable) and certificate of fitness.**

If you do not meet these conditions, you cannot directly exchange your licence for a Dutch one. This means you will need to take a standard theory and practical test at the Central Office for Motor Vehicle Driver Testing (CBR).

For more information, you can check RDW (The Government Road Transport Agency) official website [www.rdw.nl](https://www.rdw.nl). You can also call them relating to the exchange of your driving licence.
