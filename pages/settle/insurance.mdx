# Health insurance
## Introduction
General practitioners (huisarts) play an important role in the Dutch healthcare system; they are
the first port of call if you have health problems. Patients are free to choose their own doctor. It is useful to choose one close to home. Doctors have their practices in residential areas and operate on an appointment system. If necessary, the doctor will refer patients to a specialist at a hospital.

## Insurance
Everyone who lives or works in the Netherlands is legally obliged to take out standard
health insurance. When you move to the Netherlands you have 4 months to get insurance and you are covered retroactively as well as pay from the first day of arrival. So if you took out insurance after 2 months, you will have to pay retroactively for the first 2 months but also get reimbursed for all expenses in these 2 months (remember to keep bills!).

The government decides on the coverage of the standard package, so all insurers offer the same standard package. Healthcare insurers are obliged to accept anyone who applies for the standard insurance package and must charge all policyholders the same premium, regardless of their age or state of health.

You are free to choose from any health insurer but it easier to find a company that offers information in English, as many have Dutch-only websites. We recommend some of the expat-friendly health insurance providers such as **Zilveren Kruis, ONVZ, United Consumers, FBTO, Univ√© Verzekeringen, VGZ.** You can also change insurers once a year by canceling your previous insurer before 1 January and taking out new insurance before 1 February. You will then be covered with your new provider with retroactive effect from 1 January. If you sign up to a new insurer before this date, they can also cancel your current policy on your behalf. To register for health insurance, you will require a BSN.

## Own Risk 
You should keep in mind that there are two main costs that you need to pay for your Dutch health insurance: The monthly premium is a fixed fee deducted from your bank account each month. The "own risk" amount (eigen risico) is an annual amount you must pay out of your pocket for some treatments and medicines before your health insurance covers the rest. In 2021, the eigen risico is up to a maximum of 385 euros. If you do not have any medical costs in a year, you pay no eigen risico.

## Additional Insurance
Most healthcare services in the Netherlands are available through the state insurance system but not all health care services are covered by the standard package. You can opt to take out additional insurance to cover, for example, physiotherapy or dental care. If you do not need physiotherapy or dental care regularly, buying an additional package can increase the price significantly.  

## Insurance Premium
You pay a fixed, nominal premium to your insurance. Children under the age of 18 must have health insurance but do not pay any premiums for the standard package. Parents must register their child with an insurance company within four months of their birth.

## Finding Insurance
To select an insurance provider, please go to [Independer](https://www.independer.nl/zorgverzekering/intro.aspx), enter your details and select your preferred option. As a first step, you will need to provide your date of birth, gender, postal code, and if you want to include family members in insurance. Then you can choose your "own" risk and decide if you want to have any additional treatments. Mainly the difference between health providers is which hospitals and doctors they cover. However, in Amsterdam, most insurance companies cover all the hospitals, so you only need to compare the prices by using Independer.    

## Finding GP
If you purchased insurance from Ziezo/Zilveren Kruis you can use their [ZorgZoeker portal](https://zorgzoeker.zilverenkruis.nl/) where you search for GGZ and filter results with your postal code. You can then compare different GPs in your area and pick the one that best fits your needs. For different insurance providers contact their customer service and they will help you to find a GP near you or ask us and we will try to help you with the search.
