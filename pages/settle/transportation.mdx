# Public Transportation

The Dutch public transport network is clean, efficient, and relatively cheap. The local train network covers much of the country. Other towns and villages are connected by bus links, while the northern islands have ferry access. In larger cities, there is either a tram or a metro system (or both), while smaller cities and towns will have bus networks connecting suburbs with central areas. 

### Bus
Both regional and city public transport bus services can be found throughout the Netherlands. Because of the extensive rail network, long-distance bus services are limited to a few connections where train connections are missing. The city buses work at nights as well while the other means of transportation are unavailable after midnight. 


### Tram
There are trams in Amsterdam, the Hague, Rotterdam and Utrecht. They operate in these large cities because they are suitable for the transportation of large numbers of passengers.

### Subway (Metro)
In the Netherlands, Amsterdam and Rotterdam have an underground line. The metros operate in a closed system, which does not intersect with normal road traffic.

### Train
The main public transport in the Netherlands for longer distances is by train. The train network which is operated by NS (Nederlandse Spoorwegen) covers much of the country.

The OV-chipkaart:
The OV-chipkaart (OV stands for openbaar vervoer, or public transport) is the Dutch smart-card payment system that operates across the country for all public transport options. There are two types of OV-chipkaart: anonymous and personal. Anonymous cards can be bought and topped-up from GVB ticket machines and GBV ticket offices at train and metro stations. Personal cards need to be bought online, and you will need to provide a photo for the card. Wherever you are in the Netherlands, it is possible to use the OV-chipkaart for public transport. The most important tip for using your public transport chip card is to always remember to check in and check out. For more information visit https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/home-1.htm#/
