# Amsterdam
From its humble beginnings as a 13th-century fishing village on a river bed to its current role as a major hub for business, tourism, and culture, Amsterdam has long had a strong reputation as a center of culture and commerce.

Although the seat of the Dutch government is in The Hague, Amsterdam is the nominal capital. It is also the country's largest city, with a population of more than 851,000 in the city and 2.48 million in the metro area. It's also the most visited, with over 3,5 million foreign visitors a year.

## Districts
The Amsterdam Area encompasses the city of Amsterdam and 32 of its surrounding
municipalities. Amsterdam is broken up into 8 districts or boroughs (stadsdelen), which are further divided into neighborhoods.

### Centre
This area around Dam Square and Nieuwmarkt, and through the neighborhood known as De Wallen (Red Light District), is the oldest part of the city.

### Jordaan
Tightly packed streets and canals west of the city center. Once a neighborhood for the working class and emigrants, nowadays almost completely renovated and very popular among artists, students, professionals, young entrepreneurs, and tourists.

### De Pijp
One of the most cosmopolitan and vibrant districts of Amsterdam with fantastic caf√©s, restaurants, shops, and the daily Albert Cuyp street market.

### Oud-Zuid
More expensive than De Pijp and one of the most desirable residential neighborhood with the city's most fashionable shopping streets PC Hooftstraat, Van Baerlestraat and Beethovenstraat, famous museums (Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, Stedelijk Museum), Coster Diamonds, Concertgebouw, and the Vondelpark.

### West
Popular city quarter stretching west of the Singelgracht canal with quite a lot of hotels, restaurants, and cafes. West is formed by 4 other parts of the city: **Oud-West, Westerpark, Bos en Lommer & De Baarsjes and Nieuw West.** 

**Oud-West** is a dynamic neighborhood with restaurants, boutiques, design stores, alternative music venues, and trendy cafes.

**Westerpark** is another lively neighborhood of Amsterdam West. It homes cozy terraces, a big park, old-school street markets, and brown cafes.

**Bos en Lommer & De Baarsjes** are popular with their green open spaces, young and multicultural crowd. They are also further than the city center, so they are desirable to avoid the city crowd.

**Nieuw West** is bordered by the Sloterplas Lake and Rembrandt Park. The area is easily accessible from anywhere in the city by Lelylaan train station, bus, tram, and metro lines.

### Oost
In this area, you can see, taste, and smell Amsterdam's and Holland's colonial past with its museums and multicultural stores and venues.

### Noord
Across the water from Centraal Station is Amsterdam-Noord (Amsterdam North), a district that has been little more than a dull dormitory suburb up until now. This is changing, though, with dining and entertainment venues opening up.
