# Amsterdam
From its humble beginnings as a 13th-century fishing village on a river bed to its current role as a major hub for business, tourism, and culture, Amsterdam has long had a strong reputation as a center of culture and commerce.

Although the seat of the Dutch government is in The Hague, Amsterdam is the nominal capital. It is also the country's largest city, with a population of more than 851,000 in the city and 2.48 million in the metro area. It's also the most visited, with over 3,5 million foreign visitors a year.

## Districts
The Amsterdam Area encompasses the city of Amsterdam and 32 of its surrounding
municipalities. Amsterdam is broken up into 8 districts or boroughs (stadsdelen), which are further divided into neighborhoods.

**Centrum -** The center of Amsterdam is the oldest part of the city, with ancient churches, architecture, theatres, cultural institutions, and late-night pursuits, popular among tourists and expats.

**Zuid -** The south of Amsterdam with it's business centers, iconic museums, music venues, shopping streets, and restaurants. Full of modern buildings and popular among business people, with a few rental properties to offer as most of the apartments are owned by tenants.

**West -** Popular city quarter stretching west of the Singelgracht canal with many hotels, ethnic restaurants, cafes, vintage shops, and outdoor markets. Amsterdam West has its own character, close enough to the city center, within a comfortable distance from the tourist crowd with its richly diverse culture and atmosphere. 

**Oost -** The east of the city offers a change of pace, as it is home to family-friendly museums, a fun-filled zoo, and some of the city's most dazzling architecture, next to some of the most exciting bars, restaurants, and places to hang out.

**Noord -** Amsterdam-North is located north of the River IJ, which separates it from the rest of the city. This area is an inspiring and vibrant part of Amsterdam where nature, Dutch traditions, and modern-day life come together in one trendy neighborhood.
