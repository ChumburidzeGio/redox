# Amsterdam
From its humble beginnings as a 13th-century fishing village on a river bed to its current role as a major hub for business, tourism, and culture, Amsterdam has long had a strong reputation as a center of culture and commerce.

Although the seat of the Dutch government is in The Hague, Amsterdam is the nominal capital. It is also the country's largest city, with a population of more than 851,000 in the city and 2.48 million in the metro area. It's also the most visited, with over 3,5 million foreign visitors a year.
