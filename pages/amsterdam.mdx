# Amsterdam
From its humble beginnings as a 13th-century fishing village on a river bed to its current role as a major hub for business, tourism, and culture, Amsterdam has long had a strong reputation as a center of culture and commerce.

Although the seat of the Dutch government is in The Hague, Amsterdam is the nominal capital. It is also the country's largest city, with a population of more than 851,000 in the city and 2.48 million in the metro area. It's also the most visited, with over 3,5 million foreign visitors a year.

### Centre
This area around Dam Square and Nieuwmarkt, and through the neighborhood known as De Wallen (Red Light District), is the oldest part of the city.

### Jordaan

**Zuidoost** includes the residential area De Bijlmer and the Johan Cruijff ArenA, AFAS Live, and the Ziggo Dome. It's about as far away as you can get from your typical canals-and-clogs image of Amsterdam.

  **Bos en Lommer & De Baarsjes** are popular with their green open spaces, young and multicultural crowd. They are also further than the city center, so they are desirable to avoid the city crowd.

**Noord** is across the water from Centraal Station is Amsterdam-Noord (Amsterdam North), a district that has been little more than a dull dormitory suburb up until now. However, this is changing with its Noorder Park, charming little villages, quiet dining options, and waterside hangouts with beautiful terraces.
