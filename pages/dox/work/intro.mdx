# Working
It is essential to know your rights and responsibilities in the company you will start working in the Netherlands because **salaries, working hours, taxation**, and **vacations** can differ from other countries.

### Salaries
Salaries in the Netherlands are communicated on a gross (before income tax) per month or yearly. On the other hand, there is usually an hourly or weekly comparison for part-time jobs. Salaries are generally paid monthly at the end of the month. In addition, you will receive extra payment twice a year: at Christmas and in Summer (June/July), considered as vacation money.

### Working hours
A standard full-time Dutch working week is 38 hours. The majority of full-time jobs in the Netherlands are between 36-40 hours a week, or seven to eight hours a day, five days a week. On the other hand, if you work less than 36 hours a week, but more than 12, you are considered working part-time. 

Some companies have a 40-hour working week instead of the standard 38 hours, in which case you receive more salary for more hours worked. Another way to compensate for your higher weekly hours is by increasing your annual holiday leave. 

### Vacations
If you work full-time, you are entitled to minimum of 20 days (four weeks) of paid holiday leave per year. Part-time employees are also entitled to four times the number of hours they work per week. For example, a 25-hour workweek will provide you with 100 hours of annual paid holiday leave.

However, employers in the Netherlands usually offer more than the minimum number of days, with 24 and even 32 days of annual leave. This amount is stated in your work contract, and you receive regular pay during your holidays. If you have unused holidays, most employers allow unused holidays to be carried through to the following year, but it is wise to double-check this with your employer.

  Holiday leave is separate from Dutch national holidays, which are also paid if they fall on a weekday, and there are few national holidays in the Netherlands.

### Maternity/Paternity leave
If you become pregnant, you are legally entitled to at least 16 weeks of paid maternity leave. You can start your maternity leave from 4 to 6 weeks before the due date. This period before the birth, and the 10-12 weeks after, are financially covered by the maternity allowance. 

Your partner is also legally entitled to 1 workweek of paid leave when you have just given birth. It doesn't matter if the partner works full-time or part-time. For example, if the partner works five days a week, 5 hours a day, he will get 25 hours of paid leave. 

### Contracts
**Zero-hour contract:**

**Temporary contract**:

A temporary contract is a fixed-term contract that ends at the end of the period specified in the contract (shorter than six months) without notice. If you have worked for the same employer for two years on temporary contracts, you are entitled to a permanent contract if the work agreement continues. 

**Permanent contract:**

If the you have not agreed on a specific duration with your employer, an employment contract is considered to be for an indefinite period of time.  

**Termination**
