# Working
It is important to know your rights and responsibilities in the company you will start working in the Netherlands because **work contracts**, **salaries**, **working hours**, and **vacations** can differ from other countries.

You also need to know about the requirements for international workers, such as **visa regulations** and **work permits**, before you actively start working. For example, if you move to the Netherlands with your partner or spouse who accepted a job in the Netherlands as an expat, the **IND** will give you the same rights to work.  

### Contracts 
First, you should check all the details of your employment contract before accepting a job in the Netherlands. Temporary, permanent, zero-hour and freelancer contracts are the most common contracts in the Netherlands. 

- **Temporary Contract** is a fixed-term contract that ends at the end of the period specified in the contract without notice. It automatically changes to a permanent contract if you have received more than three successive temporary contracts or had several temporary contracts with your employer for more than three years. A dismissal procedure is not required to terminate the contract at the end of its duration.
- **Permanent Contract** is for an indeterminate period of time with no end date. This type of contract can only be terminated if you resign or the employer finds a reason to end the contract which must comply with strict legal guidelines unless you have a mutual agreement. 
- **Zero-hour Contract** can exist as either a temporary or permanent work agreement. In a zero-hour contract, you have no fixed working hours, and you get paid for the actual hours you work. This allows for a flexible working arrangement with your employer. 
- **Freelancer Contract**: You can also be a freelancer in the Netherlands, so you are self-employed and not committed to any single long-term client or employer. However, as a freelancer, you must draw up and sign a specific type of contract with a client that defines your working relationship.
### Salaries
Salaries in the Netherlands are communicated on a gross (before income tax) per month or yearly. On the other hand, there is usually an hourly or weekly comparison for part-time jobs. You usually get your salary monthly at the end of the month. In addition, you receive extra payment twice a year: at **Christmas** and in **Summer** (June/July), considered as vacation money.
### Working Hours
A standard full-time Dutch working week is 38 hours. The majority of full-time jobs in the Netherlands are between **36-40 hours** a week, or seven to eight hours a day, five days a week. On the other hand, if you work less than 36 hours a week, but more than 12, you are considered working **part-time**. 

Some companies have a 40-hour working week instead of the standard 38 hours, in which case you receive more salary for more hours worked. Another way to compensate for your higher weekly hours is by increasing your annual holiday leave. 

You can use [calculator](https://thetax.nl/?year=2022&startFrom=Year&salary=36000&allowance=0&socialSecurity=1&retired=0&ruling=0&rulingChoice=normal) to check your gross income per year. 
### Vacations
If you work **full-time**, you are entitled to minimum of **20 days** (four weeks) of paid holiday leave per year. **Part-time** employees are also entitled to four times the number of hours they work per week. For example, a 25-hour workweek will provide you with 100 hours of annual paid holiday leave.

However, employers in the Netherlands usually offer more than the minimum number of days, with 24 and even 32 days of annual leave. This amount is stated in your work contract, and you receive regular pay during your holidays. If you have unused holidays, most employers allow unused holidays to be carried through to the following year, but it is wise to double-check this with your employer.

### Maternity/Paternity leave
If you become pregnant, you are legally entitled to at least 16 weeks of paid maternity leave. You can start your maternity leave from 4 to 6 weeks before the due date. This period before the birth, and the 10-12 weeks after, are financially covered by the maternity allowance. 

Your partner is also legally entitled to 1 workweek of paid leave when you have just given birth. It doesn't matter if the partner works full-time or part-time. For example, if the partner works five days a week, 5 hours a day, he will get 25 hours of paid leave. 
### Parental Leave
In the Netherlands, both parents are entitled to parental leave of, at most, 26 times the length of the working week. The parental leave is unpaid unless otherwise agreed. In addition, you can apply for parental leave for children up to eight years old, and you must have been employed for at least one year.
