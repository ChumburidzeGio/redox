# Tax
The Dutch tax system works along with the more you earn, the more taxes you pay as a percentage of your income. The income tax is already included in your salary. Your employer deducts the income tax before the monthly payment, which means you get net wages transferred to your bank account. 

### Income tax
When you receive income from the Netherlands, you are required to pay income tax. You declare your income tax digitally via the [Tax Administration’s website](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/nl/home/home) (Belastingdienst). However, the website is only available in Dutch, so if you need help filling out your taxes, it is wise to get help from a **Dutch tax advisor**.

If you are employed by a company, then your income tax will be withheld from your salary by your employer. However, if you are self-employed, you must calculate and pay your income tax via the annual tax return.

### Payroll tax
Payroll tax is tax and other contributions that are withheld from an employee’s salary by the employer, which saves the employee from having to pay them later as income tax. Your payroll tax is deducted from your salary every month. Therefore, you must keep the deduction in mind when discussing your salary because there is a significant difference between your **gross salary** (bruto salaris), which includes tax, and your **net salary** (netto salaris), after the tax is deducted.

### Tax return
Even though wage tax has already been withheld from your gross salary, you often still need to complete an annual income tax return. This might be necessary to balance out the already-paid wage tax with other financial aspects such as your partner’s income, a mortgage, other income sources, or tax deductions such as study or healthcare costs.   

The Dutch fiscal year runs from 1 January to 31 December. You will receive a letter from the tax authorities asking you to complete a tax return for the previous year. The time period for submitting your annual income tax return is from March 1 to April 30, unless you or your accountant request an extension. 

If you have any questions about taxes in the Netherlands, contact the Tax and Customs Administration by going to their [website](www.belastingdienst.nl) or call their phone on **(055) 538 5385**.

**30% ruling**

The 30% ruling is a tax advantage for expats working in the Netherlands. This ruling can be seen as compensation for the expenses you have by working outside of your home country.

If your situation meets necessary conditions when you come to the Netherlands as a highly-skilled migrant, you can benefit from a 30% ruling. It means your employer can pay 30% of your salary as a tax-free allowance. So your salary will reduce by 30%, and in return, you should receive a 30% allowance as reimbursement for expenses which is not subject to income tax.

You can check from the [Tax Administration's website](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/en/individuals/content/coming-to-work-in-the-netherlands-30-percent-facility) to see if you are eligible the 30% ruling.
