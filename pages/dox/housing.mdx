# Rental Process
If you're planning a short-term stay in the Amsterdam Area (under five years), renting is your best bet. After all, contracts can be easily changed, and you're spared the effort of making major repairs or maintenance.

Relocify takes care of the whole process, and the only thing we need from you is a timely reaction to new rental offers that we send to you.

### Search
We will send you new offers from big rental websites such as [Pararius](https://www.pararius.com) or [Funda](https://funda.nl) and housing corporations like [Holland2Stay](https://www.holland2stay.com) and others a few times a day.

**Things to consider:**
- The average price for a furnished, one-bedroom apartment is â‚¬1,500-1,600 in Amsterdam, and unfurnished apartments on average cost â‚¬100-150 less.
- All prices will be excl. utilities, and frequently service costs. For 50-60mÂ² apartments, utility costs will be ~â‚¬150 per month, and service costs are mostly mentioned under the offer, and generally, they don't exceed â‚¬100.
- Most apartments will have energy labels, from `A++++` to `G`, and the cost difference per year is not massive. Ones with `A`, `B` labels have double glazing, so you spend less on heating, and the difference will be ~â‚¬15-20 per month.

### Viewings
If you like an apartment, we will try to schedule a viewing. But, again, we must react to new offers as soon as possible, as it makes a massive difference if you are in the first ten people who call for viewings.

<Callout>
    We conduct a maximum of 8 viewings per relocation, but usually, 3-4 viewings are more than enough to make an offer. Sit back, request viewings only on the apartments you like, and let us do the magic ðŸª„
</Callout>

If the request goes through, we will send you the date and time for the viewing and instructions on how to join it. Generally, you will do it via the video call, where you can see the apartment and the building virtually and ask questions.

Most viewings last 10-15 minutes, and if you like an apartment, we will make an offer on your behalf within 24 hours after the viewing.

### Offer
We can make only one offer at a time on your behalf. If the offer doesn't go through, we will continue an apartment search, but it's almost binding if the landlord accepts an offer; there are only a handful of cases when we can withdraw from the offer.

If the landlord accepts an offer, we will forward to you a draft version of the lease agreement, which we can negotiate on your behalf and which is generally **type A** or **B**:

#### Type A
Terminable by tenant: yes, per calendar month after the end of the fixed period (usually 1 year). Terminable by the landlord: yes, after the 1st fixed period. But cancellation is difficult and only for good reasons (e.g., the tenant does not pay, tenant causes a nuisance, etc.).

#### Type B
Terminable by tenant: yes, the tenant can cancel during the entire rental period per calendar month. Terminable by landlord: no, the landlord must adhere to the agreed rental period.

<Callout>
    We generally request contracts with a diplomatic clause, so just in case if you will have to leave the country within a rental period, you can present proof and stop the rent with one or two months notice period.

After negotiating a contract, we will explain the content and send it online to sign. After signing a contract, you will also receive an invoice from a rental agency, after which you will have to pay the first month's rent and the deposit (typically two months' rent). When your rental contract ends, and if you leave the property in good condition, the landlord must return a deposit within a month; otherwise, they will deduct all the reparation costs from it.

### Check-in
When the check-in day comes, we will meet you at the property and conduct an inspection. The rental agent, representing the landlord, will be present as well, in most cases with the landlord, and we will make an inspection report together.

The report clarifies any damage to the rented accommodation and items at the check-in and check-out. If you discover damages after the check-in (such as a damaged wall or furniture), you will still have a week or two to report it to the landlord or the agent by sending a picture of it.
