# Moving Services 
When you are moving to the Netherlands, you might need to bring your personal belongings, a few pieces of furniture, a vehicle, and some household goods. To start, you need to decide which belongings you want to move and what your budget looks like. 

The price of moving depends on the **transport method**, **how many items**, **shipping size**, **the value of the goods**, the **distance**, and **customs fees**. Ensure your shipping company advises you on any duties payable so that you can decide whether to leave them behind or sell them.

In addition, international moves result in longer shipping and an increased chance of meeting difficult conditions during the journey, so you should make sure goods are packed as well as possible. In that case, using professional packers might help that goods are safely and securely packed. 

However, you can also decide to pack yourself and use moving services only for shipping purposes. If you pack yourself, ensure that you pack by room and mark what is in the boxes immediately after or as you are packing.

# Europe
Relocating from another EU member country can be advantageous. The Netherlands has more flexible regulations for travelers from Europe, allowing for a higher volume of duty-free items.

Some expat-friendly companies in the Netherlands offer services for your moving from abroad, such as [Lopa Removals](https://loparemovals.com/) and [Oranje Transport](https://oranjetransport.nl/).
