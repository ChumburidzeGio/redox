# Moving Services 
When you are moving to the Netherlands, you might need to bring your personal belongings, a few pieces of furniture, a vehicle, and some household goods. Before beginning to pack, make sure that you have thought through what you should take since it will affect the cost of shipping. 

For example, many items, including electronics and motor vehicles, may incur significant customs fees. Ensure your shipping company advises you on any duties payable so that you can decide whether to leave them behind or sell them.
