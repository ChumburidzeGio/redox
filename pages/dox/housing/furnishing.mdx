# Furnishing Apartment
Moving into an unfurnished apartment might seemingly present more of a challenge, especially when relocating to a new country. Still, there are many options in the Netherlands to furnish your apartment quickly.

When you need furniture for your new apartment, [Ikea](https://www.ikea.com/nl/en/) can be a good option, offering product diversity in every price range with good quality. If you are buying large pieces of furniture, keep in mind that it has to get into your apartment, which can be tricky if you have steep and narrow stairs, so flatpack systems are ideal.

  There are wooden hoisting hooks at the top of most buildings, making it possible to get your furniture inside through the window.

There are also some second-hand shops like [Marktplaats](https://www.marktplaats.nl/) and **Facebook Marketplace** which many Dutch people use, but often self-pickup is the only way to bring it home. Depending on the seller, the delivery may be possible. 

### Renting furniture
Since itâ€™s not always clear how long you will stay in the country as an expat, renting your furniture might be another solution. It can eliminate the need and costs for temporary housing, such as hotels. 

For renting your furniture, you can check [In-lease](https://athomewith.in-lease.com/) furniture rental service. They can usually deliver and set up your new furniture within 2 to 5 working days.  

### Delivery

Ikea can be a good choice also because of their delivery service. However, suppose you bought your furniture from a place that does not deliver. In that case, you could use expat-friendly delivery companies to move your furniture like [Brenger](https://www.brenger.nl/en-nl/) or prefer a more affordable one such as [Student Moving Service](https://www.studentverhuisservice.nl/).
