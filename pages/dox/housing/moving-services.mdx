# Moving Services 
When you are moving to the Netherlands, you might need to bring your personal belongings, a few pieces of furniture, a vehicle, and some household goods. To start, you need to decide which belongings you want to move and what your budget looks like. 

The price of moving depends on the **transport method**, **how many items**, **shipping size**, **the value of the goods**, the **distance**, and **customs fees**. 

Your first step is to assess your belongings – work out their weight and volume. Once you have this information, you can approach different companies. Before you decide to hire an international removal company, you can compare quotes for various companies on comparison platforms such as [Parcel ABC](https://www.parcelabc.com/), [Eurosender](https://www.eurosender.com/), and [ReloAdvisor](https://reloadvisor.org/en/). 

In addition, international moves result in longer shipping and an increased chance of meeting difficult conditions during the journey, so you should make sure goods are packed as well as possible. In that case, using professional packers might help that goods are safely and securely packed. However, you can also decide to pack yourself and use moving services only for shipping purposes.

  Remember your first quote won’t necessarily account for additional costs such as insurance and packing. Contact the companies directly to clarify a more accurate price with these costs included.

You should also check that the company is a member of industry organizations such as the [International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations](https://fiata.org/who-we-are.html) or the [International Air Transport Association](https://www.iata.org/en/about).

Besides the comparison website, you can check with your national moving companies to deliver household goods to the Netherlands. In addition, you can contact some expat-friendly companies in the Netherlands that offer services for your moving from abroad, such as [Lopa Removals](https://loparemovals.com/) or [Oranje Transport](https://oranjetransport.nl/).
