# Banking
In the Netherlands, payment is usually made by debit card (pinpas) – a card that takes money directly from your (Dutch) bank account or occasionally with cash. Some places that are more tourist-friendly, including hotels, restaurants, bars, and grocery stores in the city centre accept also credit cards, though most other places only accept debit cards or cash due to high fees from the credit card issuers.

## Online Payments
For online payments generally, iDEAL is used, which transfers money directly from your (Dutch) bank account to the recipient's (Dutch) bank account so there are no transfer fees involved, even though transfers are immediate. For personal transfers iDeal is used as well, you go to your bank's mobile app, create a sharable link for iDeal payment or create a QR code that another person can scan to send you funds directly from their bank account. 

<callout type="warning">
    Using iDEAL can be problematic when you need a refund. It directly transfers money from one account to another, so contacting the seller would be the only option. However, if you've paid with a credit card, you can receive an immediate refund from your bank.

## Money Transfer
Before you start living in the Netherlands, you might need to transfer money to a Dutch bank account for some reason, such as renting an apartment, paying for a deposit, etc. Also, when you start living in the Netherlands, you will likely end up transferring money from your bank account to your Dutch bank account or the other way around.

You can transfer money with traditional banks. However, traditional banks often charge high fees. Therefore, online money transfer is becoming more and more popular. It is fast, secure and it does not cost a lot.

Online money transfer services save you also time. You don't have to visit your bank in person. Instead, you can use your laptop or phone and wire the money using your preferred online money transfer service.

You have a number of options in the Netherlands for making an international money transfer. Some of the popular money transfer providers are [Wise](https://wise.com/), [CurrencyFair](https://www.currencyfair.com/expatica-10), [Moneycorp](https://www.moneycorp.com/en-gb/campaigns/partners/propertyoverseas/) and [WorldRemit](https://www.worldremit.com/en/gb). In addition, some banks like **Bunq** and **N26** have direct integration of Wise in their app. So when you send money internationally by using your Bunq account, you pay only the standard Wise fees. Before choosing a provider, be sure to use Monito’s [comparison platform](https://www.monito.com/) to check the costs and fees involved with each.
