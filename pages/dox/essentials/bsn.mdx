# Obtaining BSN

Everyone living in the Netherlands must have a citizen service number, often referred to as a BSN (burgerservicenummer). You’ll need one to work, receive your salary, open a bank account, arrange health insurance, visit a doctor or hospital, or apply for benefits. 

In addition, if you leave the Netherlands and later return, you’ll keep the same citizen service number when you re-register with the municipality. International newcomers need to apply for a BSN when they arrive in the Netherlands.

    Keep in mind that the appointment date can be later than your arrival in the Netherlands due to overload work at the municipality.

### How we work
We will schedule a BSN appointment for you as soon as we start your relocation process. We partner with *In Amsterdam* - the city of Amsterdam's initiative for newcomers, so we can directly book BSN appointments for you in their system. Once we have your appointment, we will send you the confirmation email, including the list of necessary documents you will have to bring.
