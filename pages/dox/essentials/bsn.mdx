# Obtaining BSN

Everyone living in the Netherlands must have a citizen service number, often referred to as a BSN (burgerservicenummer). You’ll need one to work, receive your salary, open a bank account, arrange health insurance, visit a doctor or hospital, or apply for benefits.

In addition, if you leave the Netherlands and later return, you’ll keep the same citizen service number when you re-register with the municipality. International newcomers need to apply for a BSN when they arrive in the Netherlands.

    Keep in mind that the appointment date can be later than your arrival in the
    Netherlands due to overload work at the municipality and the IN Amsterdam.

You can still receive your salary through an [anonymous rate scheme](https://www.administratie-informatie.nl/anoniementarief) (het anoniementarief) while waiting for your BSN. Under this tax arrangement, your salary might be lower than expected until you receive your BSN, but you can receive back the difference a year after when submitting your [tax return](/dox/work/taxes).

## RNI

If you move to the Netherlands for no more than 4 months, you can register as a **non-resident** in the [Non-residents Record Database](https://www.government.nl/topics/personal-data/question-and-answer/how-i-can-register-in-the-non-residents-records-database) (RNI) in [19 RNI-municipalities](https://www.government.nl/topics/personal-data/question-and-answer/how-i-can-register-in-the-non-residents-records-database) and receive your BSN. Therefore, the BSN you will receive under the RNI will be for a [short staying](https://www.government.nl/documents/leaflets/2018/07/01/registration-for-a-short-term-stay-in-the-netherlands) in the Netherlands.

<callout type="warning">
    Non-resident BSN is a limited version of BSN and while it allows you to open
    a bank account or receive a salary, you won't be able to get the insurance
    with it for example.

### How we work

We will schedule a BSN appointment for you as soon as we start your relocation process. We partner with **IN Amsterdam** - the city of Amsterdam's initiative for newcomers, so we can directly book BSN appointments for you in their system. Once we have your appointment, we will send you the confirmation email, including the list of necessary documents you will have to bring.
