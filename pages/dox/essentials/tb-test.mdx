# Tuberculosis Test
After you have arrived in the Netherlands, you might need to undergo a medical test for **tuberculosis** (TB). If you have the nationality of one of the [countries on this list](https://ind.nl/en/Forms/7644.pdf), you do not have to undergo a TB test. Otherwise, you need to take the test within three months after the residence permit has been granted.

<callout type="warning">
  Waiting for more than three months to undergo the TB test may cause your residence permit to be withdrawn.
</callout>

If you were referred by **Immigration and Naturalisation Service** (IND) to undergo the TB test, first, you need to make an appointment with **GGD of Amsterdam** (Municipal Health Service). 

To do that, you can fill in the [Registration Form](https://formulier.amsterdam.nl/thema/ggd/tb-test/Registration-form/) for TBC immigrants and expats. Then GGD will notify you about your appointment by the post. You can also call their TB department for the appointment on **(020) 555 5240**.

Apart from your passport or ID card please take [TB test referral form](https://ind.nl/en/Forms/7604.pdf) with you to the appointment. The GGD will fill in this form and send it to the IND.

For more information, please read [General Conditions](https://ind.nl/en/Pages/General_conditions.aspx) on IND website.
