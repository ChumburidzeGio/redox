# TB test 
After you have arrived in the Netherlands, you might need to undergo a medical test for **tuberculosis** (TB). If you have the nationality of one of the countries listed in [Exemption from the obligation to undergo a TB test](https://ind.nl/en/Forms/7644.pdf), you donâ€™t have to take a TB test. Otherwise, you need to take the test within three months after the residence permit has been granted.

  Waiting for more than three months to undergo the TB test may cause your residence permit to be withdrawn.

If you were referred by **Immigration and Naturalisation Service** (IND) to undergo the TB test, first, you need to make an appointment with **GGD of Amsterdam** (Municipal Health Service). 

To do that, you can fill in the [Registration Form](https://formulier.amsterdam.nl/thema/ggd/tb-test/Registration-form/) for TBC immigrants and expats. Then GGD will notify you about your appoinment by post. You can also call their TB department to make an appointment by phoning **(020) 555 5240**.

Before you go to your appointment, you need to take the [TB test referral form](https://ind.nl/en/Forms/7604.pdf) to your appointment, including your passport or ID card. Then, the GGD fills in the rest of the form and sends it to the IND.
