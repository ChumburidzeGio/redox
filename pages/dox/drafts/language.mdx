**_Gezelligheid:_** Coziness, fun, the general togetherness that gives people a warm feeling.

**_Afbellen:_** It translates to “calling it off.” It usually refers to when you cancel on a friend last-minute.

**_Voorpret:_** That feeling of excitement you get even before an event actually takes place. Literally translates to “pre-fun.”

**_Hè hè:_** This is a hearty expression of satisfaction after a job well done or a hard day. Best used after removing your shoes or sitting down for the first time in hours.

**_Lekker:_** This word in itself can be translated into tasty, except that it can be applied to almost anything, from having a nice food to nice conversation.
