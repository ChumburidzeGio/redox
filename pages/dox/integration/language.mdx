# Dutch Language
Although almost everyone can speak English, especially in Amsterdam, understanding Dutch makes it easier to communicate with people around you. There are various websites and learning courses where you can start practicing Dutch. **Duolingo** and **Babbel** are examples of language apps for people looking to learn a new language as well as free courses from municipalities like this [official course](https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/education/learning-dutch/) from the city of Amsterdam.
