# Dutch Art

The Netherlands produced countless masterpieces across every painting category, especially in Golden Age. Although we are familiar with towering figures like Rembrandt or Vermeer, the country has so much more to offer to art fans. Here are several notable artists and their masterpieces:

    <b>Rembrandt van Rijn (1606-1669)</b>
    <br />
    Rembrandt dominated the Dutch Golden Age and is known as the master of light
    and shadow. He is not only the most famous Dutch painter but he ranks among
    the greatest the world has ever seen.

    <b>Vincent van Gogh (1853 – 1890)</b>
    <br />
    Van Gogh was a Post-Impressionist artist whose difficult life and posthumous
    fame are well known worldwide. His work is notable for its rough beauty,
    emotional honesty, and bold color and together with Pablo Picasso’s, they
    are among the world’s most expensive paintings ever sold.

    <b>Johannes Vermeer (1632-1675)</b>
    <br />
    Although Vermeer is now considered an Old Master, he was ignored in his
    time. Like many from the Golden Age of Dutch Painting, Vermeer’s fascination
    was light and the faithful and beautiful reproduction on canvas.

    <b>Piet Mondrian (1872-1944)</b>
    <br />
    Mondrian was a painter as well as an art theorist and one of the pioneers in
    abstract art painting (like Pablo Picasso). He was one of the first to dare
    to create and sell abstract representations of colour, and will always be
    remembered in history as a pioneer and “the father” of abstract art.
