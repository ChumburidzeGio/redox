## Immigration Rules 

Your pet must have an **ISO pet microchip** and be vaccinated for rabies and other diseases at least 21 days before your travel and not more than one year before the trip. If vaccinations were before the microchip insertion, your pet has to be vaccinated again after. If your pet’s microchip is not ISO 11784/11785 compliant, you will have to bring your own microchip scanner.

A USDA (or CFIA) accredited veterinarian must then complete the bilingual Annex II for the Netherlands for endorsement by the USDA or CFIA if traveling from the United States or Canada. If traveling from another country, the Governing Authority should endorse the form for you.

On the other hand, unvaccinated pets (dogs and cats only) less than three months old may enter an EU country. However, there are other additional regulations. For example, ertain aggressive breeds of dogs cannot enter to the country. 

All other pets are not subject to the regulations on the anti-rabies vaccination but may have to meet different requirements. Therefore, as a pet owner, you should ask further for information from the relevant authority of your home country and the Netherlands.
