# Bringing a pet 
Pets are welcome in the Netherlands, but it is essential to check the latest rules and regulations before bringing your pets into the country. Here is the general information you will need when you decide to move to The Netherlands with your pet. As it is a time-consuming process, it is better to start this at least 6 to 9 months in advance.

**Immigration Rules** 

Your pet must have an **ISO pet microchip** and be vaccinated for rabies and other diseases at least 21 days before your travel and not more than one year before the trip. If vaccinations were before the microchip insertion, your pet has to be vaccinated again after. If your pet’s microchip is not ISO compliant, you will have to bring your own microchip scanner.

A USDA (or CFIA) accredited veterinarian must then complete the bilingual Annex II for the Netherlands for endorsement by the USDA or CFIA if traveling from the United States or Canada. If traveling from another country, the Governing Authority should endorse the form for you.

On the other hand, unvaccinated pets (dogs and cats only) less than three months old may enter an EU country. However, there are other additional regulations. For example, ertain aggressive breeds of dogs cannot enter to the country. 

All other pets are not subject to the regulations on the anti-rabies vaccination but may have to meet different requirements. Therefore, as a pet owner, you should ask further for information from the relevant authority of your home country and the Netherlands. 

**Traveling**

The rules for containers for cats, dogs, ferrets, and birds flying in the cabin and as cargo are created by the **International Air Transport Association** (IATA). Read the [IATA requirements](https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/NL-Netherlands-customs-currency-airport-tax-regulations-details.htm) before you travel with your pet.

On the other hand, On flights of less than ten hours, many airlines allow small cats or dogs in the cabin. Generally, the airline will only allow one pet per passenger and a maximum of two pets per cabin.

**Pet Passports**

EU pet owners must have pet passports when traveling with their animals. The passports include the pet’s microchip or tattoo number for identification and other data such as records of all vaccinations and clinical examinations. 

**The passport should contain:**

- Name and address of animal owner

- Description of the animal (breed, sex, age, color)

- Number of microchip

- Date of the rabies vaccination, period of validity of the vaccination, type of vaccine, name of manufacturer and production number

- Address and signature of the veterinarian

If you want to bring an animal to the Netherlands from a country outside the EU, you should first contact the [Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority](https://english.nvwa.nl/). NVWA can tell you whether this is allowed by law, and under what conditions.

**Pet insurance** 

Another important issue is pet insurance. Depending on the level of cover you opt for, insurance can often cover many of the costs associated with vet bills and treatment in the case of injury or illness. 

Insurance companies offering pet coverage in the Netherlands are [Aegon](https://www.aegon.nl/particulier/?awc=8587_1626685335_c2c2275b72004a9fa2964c53848cd7f1), [Petplan](https://petplan.nl/?utm_source=daisycon&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=Expatica%20NL&utm_term&utm_content=63092), and [HEMA](https://verzekerdbijhema.nl/?utm_source=awin_666995&utm_medium=affiliates&utm_content=666995&awc=8413_1646306091_3432f073d9daa5e90c565dea311ae6e4). Most of these pet insurance websites allow you to calculate how much insurance would cost.

Before you get insurance for your pet, check if companies' policies cover all chronic, congenital, and hereditary conditions; if there is a time limit on treatment per condition, there are flexible coverage options to fit your budget and needs.  

**Tax**

You will not need a permit for your dog, but most cities charge an annual **Dog Tax** (hondenbelasting); prices vary on the number of dogs. Dogs must also register with the local town hall and the municipal tax office (Gemeentelijke Belastingdienst) upon arrival, which you can arrange by letter or in person. No other animals, such as cats, require registration or tax.

**Pet Services** 

The Netherlands has many animal hospitals and vets. As well as appointments, many vets offer drop-in time (spreekuur) when you can stop by unannounced for advice or in an emergency. As for health check-ups, your vet will keep you regularly informed with updates. 

[Pet Travel Clinic](https://www.dierenkliniekeuropaplein.nl/) in Amsterdam is popular among international pet owners, with services available in over five languages. You can also take a look at the official [Association of Dutch vets](https://www.knmvd.nl/).
