# Bicycle
Biking is the main and the cheapest mode of transport in the Netherlands. Most Amsterdammers ride reasonably basic bicycles, preferring not to subject an expensive bike as it might get stolen.

If you prefer to get a new bike, you can go to **bicycle shops**, but they are usually more expensive and start at €250. But it is also possible to pay around 120-250€ at a bicycle shop and buy a second-hand bike. Online shops like **Marktplaats** or some Facebook groups might be alternatives to bicycle shops for second-hand bikes.

    If you buy a bike online from a private seller or on the street, be aware that it can be stolen and get you into trouble because buying a stolen bike is a criminal offense. Always buy it from bicycle stores and request a receipt. Also, keep your bike serial number to report it to the police if it gets stolen.

If you don't want to buy a bike, subscription bikes are another affordable option. It takes away all the hassle and headache of searching, buying, and maintaining a bike of your own. The most popular one is **Swapfiets**, for more information you can check [their website](https://swapfiets.nl/en-NL).

<callout type="warning">
    Always chain your bike on something and buy a good chain whether you choose to buy a second-hand or brand new bike, as bicycle theft is common in Amsterdam.

Make sure you only park your bike at designated racks or a dedicated parking garage (stalling) because your bike might be removed in the city due to illegal parking. If your bike is removed, it will be taken it to **the Fietsdepot**. You can contact the Fietsdepot by calling them to check whether they have your bike. 

If they have your bike, you need to pay a fee of €22.50 to reclaim your bike, or approximately €35 to have it delivered to your home, and show identification and have the key to the bike lock in your possession.
