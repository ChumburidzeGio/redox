# Child Sports

A few hours of sports each week is always part of the school curriculum in the Netherlands.

Students participate in various types of sports during **physical education** (PE) classes. The school determines the number of sports and exercise the children participate in. For example, swimming lessons are standard for children in group 5 who don’t yet have their certificates.

In addition, there is a program called [Topscore](https://www.amsterdam.nl/sociaaldomein/sport/sport-onderwijs/topscore-amsterdam/) in which the city, schools, and sports clubs collaborate to motivate children to exercise more. Children can learn more about various types of sports at school, including dance, football, free running, and tennis. They can also participate in even more activities outside and after school hours.

Sports clubs, parents, and children can ask the school to join Topscore or submit ideas about introducing a new sport. The school then organizes this with the City and the sports club. You can contact the PE teacher at your kid's school for more information.

## Outside

Amsterdam facilitates and encourages extra-curricular sports participation. The City’s **Department for Sports and Recreation** organizes free sports and exercise for young people in Amsterdam.

These activities are supervised, typically at outdoor play areas, schools, or gyms. Extra activities are also offered during the school holidays. Moreover, sports clubs often organize activities, either with the City or its support.

You can check this [website](https://www.amsterdam.nl/sport/sportactiviteiten-sportlessen/sporten-kinderen/) to see the sports available per city district or contact [Sportpunt](https://www.amsterdam.nl/sociaaldomein/sport/contact-sportprofessionals/sportpunt/) and learn which activities are available in your neighbourhood for your child.
