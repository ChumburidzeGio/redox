# Pets

Pets are welcome in the Netherlands, but it is essential to check the latest rules and regulations before bringing your pets into the country. In this section, you can find the general information you will need when you decide to move to The Netherlands with your pet. As it is a time-consuming process, it is better to start this at least 6 to 9 months in advance.

## Immigration Rules

Your pet must have an **ISO pet microchip** and be vaccinated for rabies and other diseases at least 21 days before your travel and not more than one year before the trip. If vaccinations were before the microchip insertion, your pet has to be vaccinated again after. If your pet's microchip is not ISO compliant, you will have to bring your own microchip scanner.

**A USDA** (or CFIA) accredited veterinarian must then complete the bilingual Annex II for the Netherlands for endorsement by the USDA or CFIA if traveling from the United States or Canada. If traveling from another country, the **Governing Authority** should endorse the form for you.

On the other hand, unvaccinated pets (dogs and cats only) less than three months old may enter the Netherlands. However, there are other additional regulations. For example, certain aggressive breeds of dogs cannot enter the country.

All other pets are not subject to the regulations on the anti-rabies vaccination but may have to meet different requirements. Therefore, as a pet owner, you should ask further for information from the relevant authority of your home country and the Netherlands.

## Traveling

The rules for containers for cats, dogs, ferrets, and birds flying in the cabin and as cargo are created by the **International Air Transport Association** (IATA). Read the [IATA requirements](https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/NL-Netherlands-customs-currency-airport-tax-regulations-details.htm) before you travel with your pet.

On the other hand, on flights of less than ten hours, many airlines allow small cats or dogs in the cabin. Generally, the airline will only allow one pet per passenger and a maximum of two pets per cabin.

## Pet Passports

EU pet owners must have pet passports when traveling with their animals. The passports include the petâ€™s microchip or tattoo number for identification and other data such as records of all vaccinations and clinical examinations:

-   Name and address of animal owner
-   Description of the animal (breed, sex, age, color)
-   Number of microchip
-   Date of the rabies vaccination, period of validity of the vaccination, type of vaccine, name of manufacturer and production number
-   Address and signature of the veterinarian should be on the passport.

If you have any questions about bringing pets to the Netherlands from abroad, you can contact the [Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority](https://english.nvwa.nl/). They will tell you whether this is allowed by law, and under what conditions.

## Pet insurance

Another important issue is pet insurance. Depending on the level of cover you opt for, insurance can often cover many of the costs associated with vet bills and treatment in the case of injury or illness.

For example, insurance companies offering pet coverage in the Netherlands are [Aegon](https://www.aegon.nl/particulier/verzekeren/huisdierenverzekering), [Petplan](https://petplan.nl/), and [HEMA](https://verzekerdbijhema.nl/dierenverzekering). Most of these pet insurance companies' websites allow you to calculate how much insurance would cost.

Before you get insurance for your pet, check if companies' policies cover all chronic, congenital, and hereditary conditions; if there is a time limit on treatment per condition, there are flexible coverage options to fit your budget and needs.

## Tax

You will not need a permit for your dog, but most cities charge an annual **Dog Tax** (hondenbelasting); prices vary on the number of dogs. Dogs must also register with the local town hall and the municipal tax office (Gemeentelijke Belastingdienst) upon arrival, which you can arrange by letter or in person. On the other hand, other animals, such as cats, do not require registration or tax.

## Pet Services

The Netherlands has many animal hospitals and vets. As well as appointments, many vets offer drop-in time (spreekuur) when you can stop by unannounced for advice or in an emergency. As for health check-ups, your vet will keep you regularly informed with updates.

[Pet Travel Clinic](https://www.dierenkliniekeuropaplein.nl/) in Amsterdam is popular among international pet owners, with services available in over five languages. You can also take a look at the official [Association of Dutch vets](https://www.knmvd.nl/).

In addition, pet sitting services are widely available and can come in handy when you have to go away and leave your pet. Companies like [Pawshake](https://en.pawshake.nl/search?service=petSitting&placeName=Amsterdam&latitude=52.3675734&longitude=4.9041389&typeOfDateSelection=consecutive&searchType=LOCATION_BASED) and [Petbnb](https://www.petbnb.nl/en/dog-sitting/netherlands/amsterdam) have affordable prices and several trustworthy pet sitters to choose from.
