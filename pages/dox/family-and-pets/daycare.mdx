# Daycare
In the Netherlands, it is common for working parents to leave their children in kindergarten or daycare. Childcare is subject to specific laws. For example, employers are encouraged to contribute to the cost of childcare.

Children up to four years old can be looked after in a daycare center or kindergarten. Some daycare centers have special groups for babies and toddlers; others combine the two age groups. There is typically a strict timetable for play, eating, and sleeping.

Most daycare facilities are open from 08:00 to 18:00 and offer all-day care. However, some provide the possibility for half-day opening or 24-hours care. 

In Amsterdam, toddlers between the ages of two and a half and four years are entitled to a minimum of 15 hours of daycare per week (with income-dependent contributions or free). Fees for additional hours also depend on the parentsâ€™ income.

## Childcare allowance
If you want to check whether you are eligible to receive childcare allowance, you could use the [online calculation](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/rekenhulpen/toeslagen/) tool provided by the **Dutch Tax Office**. You can also download IN Amsterdam's [step-by-step guide](https://dutchreview.com/wp-content/uploads/Child-Benefits-Calculation-Tool.pdf) in English. 

You will only receive childcare benefit if your child attends a registered childcare facility that is listed in the National Childcare Register. **The National Childcare Register** contains a list of registered childcare facilities, including childcare centers. In this website, you can check if the listed daycares satisfy quality demands. It is useful to know that a red dot means the centre has had a negative report. Registered means that the childcare facilities have been approved by the municipality and the Municipal Health Services (GGD). You can also [search for a childcare facility](https://www.landelijkregisterkinderopvang.nl/pp/#/) (in Dutch).
