# Daycare
In the Netherlands, it is common for working parents to leave their children that haven’t yet started primary school in kindergarten or daycare.

Children up to four years old can be looked after in a daycare center or kindergarten and you find the daycare center yourself. Some daycare centers have special groups for babies and toddlers; others combine the two age groups. There is typically a strict timetable for play, eating, and sleeping.

Most daycare facilities are open from 08:00 to 18:00 and offer all-day care. However, some provide the possibility for half-day opening or 24-hours care. 

In Amsterdam, there is usually a waiting list for childcare. It is therefore essential to register your child as early as possible. You can already do this during pregnancy. Also, toddlers between the ages of two and a half and four years are entitled to a minimum of 15 hours of daycare per week in Amsterdam. Fees for additional hours depend on the parents’ income.

### Childcare allowance
The costs depend on the type of care daycare, the facilities, and the number of days that your child needs to go. If you want to check whether you are eligible to receive childcare allowance, you could use the [online calculation](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/rekenhulpen/toeslagen/) tool provided by the **Dutch Tax Office**. You can also download IN Amsterdam's [step-by-step guide](https://dutchreview.com/wp-content/uploads/Child-Benefits-Calculation-Tool.pdf) in English. 

You will only receive childcare benefit if your child attends a registered childcare facility that is listed in the **National Childcare Register**. Registered means that the childcare facilities have been approved by the municipality and the Municipal Health Services (GGD). In their website, you can check if the listed daycares satisfy quality demands and a red dot means the centre has had a negative report. 

You can also [search for a childcare facility](https://www.landelijkregisterkinderopvang.nl/pp/#/) (in Dutch). In addition, [Amsterdam Mamas](http://www.amsterdam-mamas.nl/articles/using-dutch-national-childcare-register) explains how to use the National Childcare Register's website. 

Amsterdam municipality's [the school finder](https://schoolwijzer.amsterdam.nl/en/) also provides all recognised childcare facilities. Use your postcode to locate your closest childcare centre and compare facilities with one another.

### Childcare through an employer
Although employers are encouraged to contribute to the cost of childcare, they are not legally obliged to do so. However, some employers rent spaces at daycare centers, and others have their own daycare centers. In both cases, the waiting lists are often shorter and lower costs.
