# Nannies

Instead of sending your children to a daycare center, you may choose to have them looked after by a babysitter. There are several ways to find a good babysitter in the Netherlands, even if you have just arrived and don’t have a network to rely on.

You can talk to the few people you already know if they have children old enough to babysit, they know someone, or check Facebook groups. Otherwise, you can also use an **online agency** to link you to a sitter or nanny. In this case, a babysitter who is registered with an agency would take care of your children in their home or yours, and you get in touch with the babysitters through an agency.

    You cannot receive financial assistance from the government for using a
    babysitter. In addition, the sitter has to officially register at a
    childminder agency and be certified for parents to be eligible for child
    care allowance.

The babysitter can agree to take care of your children during the evening, night or weekend. Most agencies offer regular and one-time-only sitters, but it depends on how they select the sitter and the type of services they offer.

You should check carefully what the selection process is for babysitters. Sometimes agencies just scan the profile the sitters fill in on the website; others perform a thorough investigation, including a social media check, and have personal meetings and training sessions.

### Fee & Payment

Babysitters earn a fee based on their age and the number of children they have to take care of. Some agencies have different prices when children are awake and asleep, but it is not always the case. The average fee varies depending on where you live. For example, in Amsterdam, sitters cost **€7-15 per hour**, while the average in other cities is much lower. However if you ask the sitter to help you with other small tasks around the house, an hourly fee of **€12-15 per hour** is reasonable.

For more information on how much to pay your babysitter, see [NIBUD](https://www.nibud.nl/consumenten/hoeveel-betaal-ik-de-oppas/) (in Dutch).

In addition, the fee babysitters ask for is sometimes decided by the agencies that sitters work for. In this case, you often pay the agency rather than the sitter. With other agencies, or if it's a friend or neighbor, you pay the sitter directly after you come home.
