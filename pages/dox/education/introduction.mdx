# Education in the Netherlands
Education is compulsory in the Netherlands between the ages of 5 and 16. In Dutch public schools, the instruction language is Dutch, but bilingual and international schools teach in mixed or English. 

Children in the Netherlands get 8 years of primary education, 4, 5, or 6 years of secondary education (depending on the type of school). After secondary school, they can go on to vocational education or higher education.

There are both public and private institutions at all levels of the education system; the private institutions are mostly based on religious or ideological principles.

You can visit the [‘Scholen op de Kaart’](https://scholenopdekaart.nl/) and enter your postcode to see a list of schools in your area and tick **‘basisschool’** for primary and **‘middelbare school’** for secondary schools.

## How we work
We help you to make the transition as easy as possible for your children when it comes to finding a suitable school for them in the Netherlands.

**Things to consider**:

- **A Dutch or International school**: It is important to decide if you want your kids to go to a Dutch or international school. (If you are going to stay long in the country, ages of your kids, curriculum, etc.)
- **City/Neighborhood**: Where you would like to live is also essential because some schools might not have spots for your children at the time of your relocation.
- **Newcomers' class**: Depending on your kids' age, they might have to go to newcomers' class to learn the Dutch language before they can continue in Dutch schools. There are no additional costs for attending a newcomers' class.

Firstly, we learn about your expectations and preferences mentioned above; then, we contact the schools to check if they have available spots in your children's age groups. The schools usually send their intake forms before enrolling the children.

    In most cases, you need to have an address in the Netherlands already when you fill out the forms.

We hand the forms you filled to the available schools and schedule digital meetings with them so you can ask all your questions regarding their education system.

During the meeting, the schools' administration will let us know when your children can start and what documents they will need to have for the enrollment. Then, after all the administrative procedures are completed, your children can start going to the schools.
