# Buying property
If you plan to stay in Amsterdam for the long term, it might be wiser to buy a property at a certain point instead of living in a rented apartment, as there are many long-term benefits to owning your own house.

This page explains key points of purchasing a property in Amsterdam, such as where to look for houses, financial aspects of it, legal procedures, and helpful tips.

### Search
Prices vastly differ around the Netherlands and have risen sharply in recent years, especially in urban areas like Amsterdam, due to housing shortages.

You can start checking listing websites such as [Funda](https://www.funda.nl/en/), [Pararius](https://www.pararius.nl/), [Huispedia](https://huispedia.nl/) and filter out some neighborhoods you like with extra filters based on your preferences. Things to consider:

- While setting the budget apart from property price, consider **additional costs** such as transfer tax, mortgage arrangement, estate agent fee (if you have one), and notary costs. They add up to approximately **5–7%** of the purchase price.
- Buying a property does not necessarily mean purchasing the land on which the building stands. Frequently, especially in Amsterdam, you will have to pay a rent called [Ground Lease](https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/housing/ground-lease/) to the municipality.
- Most people use real estate agents to find a house and for a bidding advice. You can compare them on [Juiste Makelaar](https://juistemakelaar.nl/en/) and their services cost 1-2% of the property purchase price.


### Mortgage

The Netherlands does not place any restrictions on the purchase of property by foreigners, whether resident or non-resident. However, to get a mortgage you must live and be registered in the Netherlands.

Mortgage interest rates are at an all-time low, and some banks may lend 100% of the evaluated property price. However, if your purchase price was higher than the evaluation report, you will have to pay the difference.

It is way easier to get a mortgage if you have an employment contract than being a freelancer. Even if you don't have a permanent contract, you can ask your employer to give you an employer statement. It states that they will renew your contract as long as nothing changes.

There are different types of mortgages, so it is recommended that you get an advisor to help you find the right choice for your financial situation,  especially if you are new to the Dutch property market.

You can compare offers from different banks in the [mortgage calculator](https://expatsamsterdam.com/mortgage-calculator/).

### Viewings
Call the real estate agent or owner listed to schedule a viewing if you like a property. You should react to new offers as soon as possible as homes in popular areas go off-market very quickly.

Viewings take place between business hours (9 am – 5 pm) and last 10-15 minutes. If you like a property, the agency will tell you how to send an offer after the viewing.

### Offer
If you think you have found a place you want to live in, you must bid on it. Since the Amsterdam market is very competitive, you will usually need to offer 10-15% above the asking price. The offer generally has a bidding price, whether your finances are already pre-approved by the bank, if you want an inspection, and your ideal move-in date.

### Contract
In most cases, the landlord or the real estate agency finds the notary for drafting the purchase agreement. However, if it's your responsibility, check [Notaristarieven](https://www.notaristarieven.nl/tarieven-vergelijken) where you can search in your area and compare prices.

It usually takes a week to draft the purchase agreement. Once you sign it, a contract is legally binding. However, as a buyer, you have a three-day cooling-off period to change your mind without explaining.
