# Shopping

[Albert Heijn](https://www.ah.nl/) is the most well-known supermarket with good food quality and the most expensive. On the other hand, [Jumbo](https://www.jumbo.com/) and [Dirk](https://www.dirk.nl/) are more affordable supermarkets. There are even cheaper alternatives like [Lidl](https://www.lidl.nl/) and [Aldi](https://www.aldi.nl/) but lower quality. Also, some supermarkets are known for vegan, organic, and gluten-free products, such as [Marqt](https://www.marqt.nl/) and [Ekoplaza](https://www.ekoplaza.nl/nl).

    If you don't want to pay for shopping bags at supermarkets, you should bring
    your bag from home.

### Grocery & food delivery

Suppose you cannot get to the supermarket in person or prefer home delivery. In that case, you can order from [Albert Heijn](https://www.ah.nl/over-ah/app), [Jumbo](https://www.jumbo.com/), or online-only supermarkets such as [Picnic](https://picnic.app/nl/), [Gorillas](https://gorillas.io/en), [Flink](https://www.goflink.com/en) or [Getir](https://getir.com/nl/).

There are also food delivery platforms like [Thuisbezorgd](https://www.thuisbezorgd.nl/en/) and [UberEats](https://www.ubereats.com/nl). You can download their apps, and these platforms will show you restaurants in your neighborhood.

### Online shopping

[Zalando](https://www.zalando.nl/), [Wehkamp](https://www.wehkamp.nl/), [SNS](https://www.sneakersnstuff.com/en), [Sneaker District](https://www.sneakerdistrict.nl/), [Baskets](https://www.baskets-store.com/nl/) are good online clothing stores in the Netherlands. If you need different products such as electronics, clothing, living, etc., from the same store, stores like [Hemma](https://www.hema.nl/), [Bol.com](https://www.bol.com/nl/nl/), and [Action](https://www.action.com/nl-nl/) might be good options to check.

When you need furniture for your new apartment, you can check [IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/nl/en/). It is cheap and of good quality. There are also some second-hand shops like [Marktplaats](https://www.marktplaats.nl/), which many Dutch people use.

<callout type="warning">
    We recommend checking online shop reviews before ordering there for the
    first time. You can do it by simply googling the website name and reviews.
