# DigiD

[DigiD](https://www.digid.nl/) is a means of identifying yourself when accessing many services and government websites. You can also use DigiD when you are outside of the Netherlands.

You need your DigiD to do your administration online in the Netherlands. For example, with your DigiD, you can access My Government, My Allowances, city municipalities, and Dutch health insurance companies.

### Applying for DigiD

You can request a DigiD for free on the DigiD official website by clicking **"apply" (aanvragen)**. The online application form has three steps and is only in Dutch. For more information and how to apply, visit their [website](https://www.digid.nl/en/apply-or-activate-digid)

  You cannot apply for or use DigiD on another personâ€™s behalf, and never give your login details to anyone else.
