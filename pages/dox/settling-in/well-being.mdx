[//]: # (## Mental Healthcare)

[//]: # (In the Netherlands, you have access to a different type of mental healthcare. Mental healthcare operates directly through the [GGZ]&#40;https://ggz.nl/&#41; &#40;Geestelijke Gezondheids Zorg or Mental Healthcare&#41;, the institution in charge of mental healthcare facilities and professionals. )

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Other relevant institutions include [PsyQ]&#40;https://www.psyq.nl/&#41;, which provides overall mental health assistance, including psychology and psychiatry, and [Parnassia]&#40;https://www.parnassia.nl/&#41;, specializing in psychiatry. Also, NGOs like [Access NL]&#40;https://access-nl.org/counselling/counsellor-on-call/&#41; are dedicated to expat healthcare and provide an on-call counseling service. )

[//]: # (  Your GP is your first line of contact for your mental health. If for a GP it seems necessary, they will refer you to primary or secondary mental healthcare provider.)

[//]: # (**Primary care** is designed to treat mild to moderate problems and includes counseling sessions with a psychologist, psychotherapist, or psychiatrist. However, **secondary care** is meant for more severe diagnoses such as ADHD, depression, or PTSD, which sometimes involves a specific facility for treatment.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Basic health insurance policies usually cover a primary care consultation under their ‘mental healthcare’ section. However, for in-depth and secondary care treatment, coverage can change depending on your health insurance policy. Therefore it’s essential to check this with your provider first. Otherwise, some mental healthcare fees might be left out, and you may need to pay for these yourself.)

[//]: # (On the other hand, there are trained professionals who provide social services, including aid in psychological issues. They are available 24/7, and you don’t require a referral from your GP to access them. Other organizations such as [International Social Service Netherlands]&#40;https://issnetherlands.nl/en/home-en/&#41; &#40;ISSN&#41; also provide similar private services. )
