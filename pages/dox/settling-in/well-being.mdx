## Mental Healthcare
Mental well-being is an essential element to a healthy life. Navigating mental health services in a different country can be challenging, but, fortunately, in the Netherlands, you have access to a range of mental healthcare.

In the Netherlands, mental healthcare operates directly through the [GGZ](https://ggz.nl/) (Geestelijke Gezondheids Zorg or Mental Healthcare), the institution in charge of the complete network of mental healthcare facilities and professionals. Other relevant institutions include [PsyQ](https://www.psyq.nl/), which provides overall mental health assistance, including psychology and psychiatry, and [Parnassia](https://www.parnassia.nl/), specializing in psychiatry.

Your GP is your first line of contact for your mental health. If a GP deems it necessary, they will refer you to primary or secondary mental healthcare. 

Primary care is designed to treat mild to moderate problems and includes counseling sessions with a psychologist, psychotherapist, or psychiatrist. However, secondary care is meant for more severe diagnoses such as ADHD, depression, or PTSD, which sometimes involves a specific facility for treatment.

  The major health providers in the Netherlands usually cover basic mental healthcare. However, the type of care included in the coverage will depend on the insurance provider and policy; therefore, itâ€™s essential to check this with them first. Otherwise, some mental healthcare fees might be left out, and you may need to pay for these yourself.
