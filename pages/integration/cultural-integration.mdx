<Callout>
  There is no law that says employees must be given a day off work on certain public holidays. So no one has a legal right to a day off on a public holiday. Your collective labour agreement or employment contract will tell you if you have the day off on public holidays.

### Giving gifts
If you invite a Dutch person to your birthday party, the chances are that you may be asked if you have a gift preference because they are practical people. It is all about giving something useful to the receiver. From the practical point of view, this prevents a gift from being “unwanted junk,” which may end up cluttering your house or being thrown out.

However, if you prefer to surprise the person with a gift of your own choice, by all means, feel free to do so. Just make sure that you don't buy something costly as it might seem rude to a Dutch person. 
### Splitting bills
Dutch people usually pay their own expenses, rather than any one person in the group defraying the cost for the entire group. 

However, it is also typical that someone is willing to pay the whole pill in more crowded events such as birthdays and company lunches. Then the others often use the Tikkie to pay back what they owe or split the bill evenly to save some trouble if individual expenses are similar. 
### Dutch food
Although Dutch cuisine is not very rich, you should try some typical Dutch food. For example, if you like fried food, you can try **Bitterballen, Kroketten, Dutch fries**. In addition, **Dutch pancakes, apple pie, and Stroopwafel** are famous as a dessert. 

Other known Dutch food examples are **Raw herring, Kibbeling, Stamppot.**

### Meetings
Dutch people keep strict agendas for their meetings. They usually make their plans weeks in advance. And **Dutch people are never late for an appointment**, so they expect you to take the same care with your timekeeping.
