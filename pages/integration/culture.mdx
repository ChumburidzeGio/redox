# Dutch Culture
Once you move to a different country, whether you want it or not, you will meet the culture of your destination. Therefore, it is crucial to know the Dutch culture before you come to The Netherlands. Like every nation, Dutch people also have some characteristics, making their culture interesting to newcomers. 

Dutch people are straightforward compared to other cultures. They say it as it is, and sometimes people might find it blunt and offensive. However, Dutch people don’t mean it that way.

Another cultural fact is that while the Dutch prefer privacy in their homes and workspaces, this longing for privacy also extends to their interactions with other people. The Dutch need some time to get to know other people before opening up.

The Dutch maybe some of the most pragmatic people in the world. They tend to rationalize and analyze everything before proceeding with their actions. But don’t worry! The Dutch know how to have fun and relax; their practical side mostly comes up in work situations.

### Dutch Values
Everyone in the country can share their opinions equally. Openness is essential to the Dutch. While you are open, you also need to be transparent because they value honesty. 

Tolerance (verdraagzaamheid) is another prominent Dutch cultural value, and it’s taught to children from a young age. The Dutch tradition of tolerance revolves around respecting people’s freedom of choice regarding their attitudes and beliefs.

#### Giving gifts
If you invite a Dutch person to your birthday party, the chances are that you may be asked if you have a gift preference because they are practical people. It is all about giving something useful to the receiver. From the practical point of view, this prevents a gift from being “unwanted junk,” which may end up cluttering your house or being thrown out.

However, if you prefer to surprise the person with a gift of your own choice, by all means, feel free to do so. Just make sure that you don't buy something costly as it might seem rude to a Dutch person.

#### Splitting bills
Dutch people usually pay their own expenses, rather than any one person in the group defraying the cost for the entire group. 

However, it is also typical that someone is willing to pay the whole pill in more crowded events such as birthdays and company lunches. Then the others often use the Tikkie to pay back what they owe or split the bill evenly to save some trouble if individual expenses are similar.

#### Dutch food
Although Dutch cuisine is not very rich, you should try some typical Dutch food. For example, if you like fried food, you can try **Bitterballen, Kroketten, Dutch fries**. In addition, **Dutch pancakes, apple pie, and Stroopwafel** are famous as a dessert. Other known Dutch food examples are **Raw herring, Kibbeling, Stamppot.**

#### Meetings
Dutch people keep strict agendas for their meetings. They usually make their plans weeks in advance. And **Dutch people are never late for an appointment**, so they expect you to take the same care with your timekeeping.
