## History of Netherlands
The 17th century is the Dutch Golden Age, which revolved around flourishing Amsterdam. At this time, artists such as Rembrandt led a cultural renaissance in the city while Dutch ships sailed worldwide, bringing back exotic and highly valued products such as spices and silk. The end of the Golden Age was signaled in 1672 when the Netherlands was attacked by pretty much all of its neighbors, France, England, and two German states combined.

Despite all the war destructions and hardship, the Dutch continued expansion on the seas and discoveries of the new routes and lands. By the mid-17th century, the Republic was the biggest maritime power of Europe, and Amsterdam was the most important financial center of the continent.

The growth of the liberal and republican ideas worldwide and resistance to these ideas by the ruler of the Dutch Republic led to the creation of The Kingdom of the Netherlands at the end of the 18th century.  

In the second half of the 19 century, the Netherlands became a liberal and modern state with constant economic growth. Although the Netherlands remained neutral during WWI, the country was invaded by the Nazis. 

After the difficult years of reconstruction directly after WWII, the Netherlands sustained a continuous and fast economic growth in the second half of the 20th century. As a result, today, the Netherlands is one of the most developed and wealthiest countries in the world. 

## History of Amsterdam 
Amsterdam, has always been a well-known name in world history and played a central role in the history of the Netherlands. In the 17th century Amsterdam was the centre of world economy, and nowadays the city is known for its tolerant character.

The 60 years following the war saw Amsterdam change immensely. It moved from being a trade city to a service-based city and became a lot more liberally minded following the fascism of WWII. There was a clean-up of the police force, and several liberalization movements from the 1960s to the 1980s had a significant impact. Amsterdam also became renowned for its tolerance to soft drug use. This remains the case today, although the Dutch combine it with their traditional business acumen and sense and have managed to turn it into a thriving industry.

## New Amsterdam as New York
In the Dutch Golden Age, almost half of all sailors, craftsmen, shipbuilders, merchants, and soldiers in the service of the Dutch Republic were foreign – English, German, French, Polish. One of the most interesting of these personages was Henry Hudson, English explorer charged by the Dutch Far East Company to find the passage through North America to Asia. 

He described in 1609 and made the first maps of the island inhabited by Indians Manna-Hatta, the piece of land we call today Manhattan. Within less than twenty years, a small urban settlement called New Amsterdam were established on the island. 

In 1625 the city became a seat for the Dutch West India Company. To make it all legal, the island was purchased by the Dutch from the Indian tribe in the same year, and the settlement received its city rights. Later, the Dutch lost the island and the city to the English, who changed its name to New York, but New Amsterdam was accepted as the year of New York beginning.
