## History of Netherlands
The 17th century is known as the Dutch Golden Age. At that time, Dutch ships sailed worldwide, bringing back exotic and highly valued products such as spices and silk. The end of the Golden Age was signaled in 1672 when the Netherlands was attacked by pretty much all of its neighbors, France, England, and two German states combined.

Despite all the war destructions and hardship, the Dutch continued expansion on the seas and discoveries of the new routes and lands. By the mid-17th century, the Republic was the biggest maritime power of Europe, and Amsterdam was the most important financial center of the continent.

The growth of the liberal and republican ideas worldwide and resistance to these ideas by the ruler of the Dutch Republic led to the creation of The Kingdom of the Netherlands at the end of the 18th century.  

In the second half of the 19 century, the Netherlands became a liberal and modern state with constant economic growth. Although the Netherlands remained neutral during WWI, the country was invaded by the Nazis. 

After the difficult years of reconstruction directly after WWII, the Netherlands sustained a continuous and fast economic growth in the second half of the 20th century. As a result, today, the Netherlands is one of the most developed and wealthiest countries in the world. 

## History of Amsterdam 
Amsterdam, has always been a well-known name in world history and played a central role in the history of the Netherlands. In the 17th century Amsterdam was the centre of world economy, and nowadays the city is known for its tolerant character.

By the end of the 15th century, the city developed rapidly. After the Spaniards conquered Antwerp, many wealthy Jews fled to Amsterdam. The money they brought with them was used to organise trips to India, which proved a huge commercial success. Then in 1602, the Dutch East India Company was founded. The city of Amsterdam had a majority share in the organisation, which was to become the first multinational company in the world. 

Amazingly, the first stock market in the world was invented by Dutch legislators and businessmen back in 1602. This was done as a means of funding the Dutch East India Company and its long trade-based voyages from the Netherlands. The Amsterdam Stock Exchange was also created in the same year, and many consider this to be the oldest ‘modern’ exchange in the world. All these developments caused the 17th century to become known as the Golden Age.

The art scene was also flourishing at this time. In the first half of the 17th century, the number of artists grew enormously and there was an explosion of art and art dealers in Amsterdam. Within just 30 years, Amsterdam became a thriving cultural city, leaving a legacy of Rembrandt van Rijn, Johannes Vermeer and Jan Steen.

The 60 years following the war saw Amsterdam change immensely. It moved from being a trade city to a service-based city and became a lot more liberally minded following the fascism of WWII. There was a clean-up of the police force, and several liberalization movements from the 1960s to the 1980s had a significant impact. Amsterdam also became renowned for its tolerance to soft drug use. This remains the case today, although the Dutch combine it with their traditional business acumen and sense and have managed to turn it into a thriving industry.

## New Amsterdam as New York
In the Dutch Golden Age, almost half of all sailors, craftsmen, shipbuilders, merchants, and soldiers in the service of the Dutch Republic were foreign – English, German, French, Polish. One of the most interesting of these personages was Henry Hudson, English explorer charged by the Dutch Far East Company to find the passage through North America to Asia. 

He described in 1609 and made the first maps of the island inhabited by Indians Manna-Hatta, the piece of land we call today Manhattan. Within less than twenty years, a small urban settlement called New Amsterdam were established on the island. 

In 1625 the city became a seat for the Dutch West India Company. To make it all legal, the island was purchased by the Dutch from the Indian tribe in the same year, and the settlement received its city rights. Later, the Dutch lost the island and the city to the English, who changed its name to New York, but New Amsterdam was accepted as the year of New York beginning.

## Curiosity 
**Tulips**
While tulips may be very popular in the Netherlands, they didn’t originate here. The colorful tulip was actually imported from Turkey in the 16th century, and it has played an important role in Dutch culture ever since. 

Now, every third Saturday in January, the Dutch celebrate National Tulip Day – the official start of the tulip season – with free flower picking and flower festivals. And, the best place to see tulips in Holland is **Keukenhof** which is a park with 7 million flower bulbs surrounded by tulip fields. 

**Coffee** 
The race among Europeans to obtain live coffee trees or beans was eventually won by the Dutch in 1616. Pieter van den Broecke, a Dutch merchant, obtained some of the closely guarded coffee bushes from Mocha, Yemen, in 1616. He took them back to Amsterdam and found a home for them in the Botanical gardens, where they began to thrive. The beans from Yemen adjusted well to conditions at **the Amsterdam Botanical Garden(Hortus)** and produced **Coffea arabica** bushes. 

Later, the traders of the Dutch East India Company managed to transport coffee from the Dutch colony of Java to the Netherlands and within a few years, the Dutch colonies had become the main suppliers of coffee to Europe.
