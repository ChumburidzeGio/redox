# Dutch Language
Although almost everyone can speak English, especially in Amsterdam, understanding Dutch makes it easier to communicate with people around you. There are various websites and learning courses where you can start practicing Dutch. **Duolingo** and **Babbel** are examples of language apps for people looking to learn a new language.

Also, most municipalities offer Dutch courses for non-Dutch speakers. For example, you can check the Amsterdam municipality [official website](https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/education/learning-dutch/) if you want to learn Dutch. You can also go to meetups and practice Dutch with a Dutch person who wants to learn your native language.
