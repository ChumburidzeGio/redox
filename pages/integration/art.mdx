# Dutch Art
The Netherlands produced countless masterpieces across every category of painting, especially in Golden Age. Although we are familiar with towering figures like Rembrandt or Vermeer, the country has so much more to offer to art fans. Here are several notable artists and their masterpieces:

    **Johannes Vermeer (1632-1675)**\
    Although Vermeer is now considered an Old Master, he was ignored in his time. Like many from the Golden Age of Dutch Painting, Vermeer’s fascination was light and the faithful and beautiful reproduction on canvas.

    **Piet Mondrian (1872-1944)**\
    Mondrian was a painter as well as an art theorist, and one of the pioneers in abstract art painting (like Pablo Picasso). He was one of the first to dare to create and sell abstract representations of colour, and will always be remembered in history as a pioneer and “the father” of abstract art.
