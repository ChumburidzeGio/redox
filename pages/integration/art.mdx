# Art 
The Netherlands produced countless masterpieces across every category of painting, especially in Golden Age. Although we are familiar with towering figures like Rembrandt or Vermeer, the country has so much more to offer to art fans. 

**Rembrandt van Rijn (1606-1669)**

Rembrandt dominated the Dutch Golden Age which is considered as a very important period in the development of art. He is known as the master of light and shadow. His paintings are of exceptional realism always making use of his trademark of light and shadow effects. Rembrandt is most famous for his portraits and depictions of biblical scenes. 

In portraiture Rembrandt captured the various moods of his subjects brilliantly and as a self-portrait artist he is known for not showing any mercy to himself. Rembrandt is not only the most famous Dutch painter but he ranks among the greatest the world has ever seen.

**Johannes Vermeer (1632-1675)** 
Although Vermeer is now considered an Old Master, he was ignored in his time. Like many from the Golden Age of Dutch Painting, Vermeer’s fascination was light and the faithful and beautiful reproduction on canvas. 

This can best be seen in his most famous work, *Girl With a Pearl Earring*, in which the interplay of light upon the various fabrics and the excellent reflection shining on that pearl earring make it one of the masterpieces of western art.

**Jan Steen (1626 – 1679)**

Jan Steen was one of the most prolific painters of the Dutch Golden Age. Although he also excelled in other genres, he is most famous for genre art that depicts everyday life scenes. 

Many of his works bear references to Dutch proverbs and literature, and many have a moral for the viewer. In addition, Steen’s sense of humor has made him hugely popular in the Netherlands, and “a Jan Steen household” has become a Dutch proverb for a messy scene.

**Vincent van Gogh (1853 – 1890)** 

Vincent Van Gogh was a Post-Impressionist artist whose difficult life and posthumous fame are well known around the world. During his life Van Gogh’s work was known to only a handful of people. He rose to fame in the early 20th century, a decade after his death, and now considered one of the greatest painters of all time.

Van Gogh’s work is notable for its rough beauty, emotional honesty, and bold color. His paintings have had a deep and profound influence on twentieth century art and together with Pablo Picasso’s they are among the world’s most expensive paintings ever sold.
