Moving into an unfurnished apartment might seemingly present more of a challenge, especially when relocating to a new country. Still, there are many options in the Netherlands to furnish your apartment quickly. 

When you need furniture for your new apartment, [Ikea](https://www.ikea.com/nl/en/) can be a good option, offering product diversity in every price range with good quality. Ikea can be a good choice also because of their delivery service. If you are buying large pieces of furniture, keep in mind that it has to get into your apartment, which can be tricky if you have steep and narrow stairs, so flatpack systems are ideal.

  There are wooden hoisting hooks at the top of most buildings, making it possible to get your furniture inside through the window.

There are also some second-hand shops like **Marktplaats** and **Facebook Marketplace** which many Dutch people use, but often self-pickup is the only way to bring it home. Depending on the seller, the delivery may be possible.
