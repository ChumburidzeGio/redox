# Biking
Biking is the main and the cheapest mode of transport in the Netherlands.

### Where to get it?
If you prefer to get a new bike, you can go to a **bicycle shop**, but they are usually more expensive. But it is also possible to pay around 120-250â‚¬ at a bicycle shop and buy a second-hand bike. Online shops like **Marktplaats** or some Facebook groups might be alternatives to bicycle shops for second-hand bikes.

    If you buy a bike online from private seller or on the street be aware that it can be stolen and get you into a trouble. Always buy it from bicycle stores and request a receipt. Also, keep your bikes serial number so you can report it to the police if it gets stolen.

However, if you don't want to buy a bike, subscription bikes are affordable. It takes away all the hassle and headache of searching, buying, and maintaining a bike of your own. The most popular one is Swapfiets, for more information check [their website](https://swapfiets.nl/en-NL).

<Callout warning>
    Always chain your bike on something and buy a good chain, as bicycle theft is common in Amsterdam.
