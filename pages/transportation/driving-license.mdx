# Driving license
If you plan to stay long-term in the Netherlands, it is often worth exchanging your foreign driving license for a **Dutch rijbewijs.** 

- If you have an EU/EEA license issued before January 19, 2013, you can drive with your license for 10 years after it was issued. If it is issued after January 19, 2013, you can drive with it for up to 15 years.

- All other non-EU countries' licenses are valid for 185 days from the date you register at your local municipality. You will need to exchange your license within that first six-month period. 

**You can exchange your driver license if:** 

- You live in the Netherlands and are registered with your local municipality with a valid resident permit (unless you are a citizen of the EU, EEA, or Switzerland) 

- You are from the EU/EEA, Switzerland OR are from a country with a special agreement, OR you receive the 30% tax ruling 

- Your current driving license is valid

- You obtained your current driving license while being a resident of that country for at least half a year (185 days) 

If you meet the above conditions for exchanging your driving license, you need to submit your application at Amsterdam municipality. They will forward your application to the Road Transportation Authority (RDW). For the application, you need valid identity documents such as a **passport, residence permit unless you are a citizen of the EU/EEA or Switzerland, proof of 30% tax ruling, your foreign driving license, your BSN, and a photo.**

You may also be asked for a certificate of fitness or VvG (verklaring van geschiktheid) to prove you are physically and psychologically fit to drive. You can get the VvG form your municipality, at Mijn CBR (log in with your DigiD) or from certain expat centres.

  If you do not meet these conditions, you cannot directly exchange your license for a Dutch one. This means you will need to take a standard theory and practical test at the Central Office for Motor Vehicle Driver Testing (CBR).
