# Public Transportation

The Dutch public transport network is clean, efficient, and relatively cheap. The local train network covers much of the country. Other towns and villages are connected by bus links, while the northern islands have ferry access. In larger cities, there is either a tram or a metro system (or both), while smaller cities and towns will have bus networks connecting suburbs with central areas. 

## Bus
Both regional and city public transport bus services can be found throughout the Netherlands. Because of the extensive rail network, long-distance bus services are limited to a few connections where train connections are missing. The city buses work at nights as well while the other means of transportation are unavailable after midnight. 


## Tram
There are trams in Amsterdam, the Hague, Rotterdam and Utrecht. They operate in these large cities because they are suitable for the transportation of large numbers of passengers. The tram usually runs from 6 AM in the morning until after midnight. 

## Subway (Metro)
In the Netherlands, Amsterdam and Rotterdam have an underground line. The metros operate in a closed system, which does not intersect with normal road traffic.

## Train
The main public transport in the Netherlands for longer distances is by train. The train network which is operated by NS (Nederlandse Spoorwegen) covers much of the country.

## Bike 
Biking is the main and the cheapest mode of transport in the Netherlands. 

### The ways to get a bike in the Netherlands 
If you prefer to get a new bike, you can go to a **bicycle shop**, but they are usually more expensive. But it is also possible to pay around 120-250€ at a bicycle shop and buy a second-hand bike. Online shops like **Marktplaats** or some Facebook groups might be alternatives to bicycle shops for second-hand bikes. 

However, if you don't want to buy a bike, subscription bikes are affordable. It takes away all the hassle and headache of searching, buying, and maintaining a bike of your own. The most popular one is Swapfiets, which costs 19.50€ per month. The service includes delivery, repairs, theft, and you can cancel anytime.

    When you decide to buy a bike, especially online, don't forget to check how much it costs as it can be stolen. And keep the serial number on your bike so you can report it to the police if it gets stolen.

<Callout warning>
    It would be best if you always park your bike correctly, buy a locker with a good and always chain on something.

## The OV-chipkaart
The OV-chipkaart (OV stands for openbaar vervoer, or public transport) is the Dutch smart-card payment system that operates across the country for all public transport options. There are two types of OV-chipkaart: anonymous and personal. 

**Anonymous cards** can be bought and topped-up from GVB ticket machines and GBV ticket offices at train and metro stations. 

**A personal OV-chipkaarts** costs € 7,50 and is valid for five years. To buy it, you will need to register online from the OV-chipkaart official website, and you will need to provide a photo for the personal card. You can charge your personal card online so that you always have sufficient credit on your card. You can also view your travel details through My OV-chip and easily print off a travel expenses overview for your employer. For more details, visit the OV-chipkaart official website https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/purchase-an-ov-chipkaart/apply-for-personal-ov-chipkaart.htm 

Wherever you are in the Netherlands, it is possible to use the OV-chipkaart for public transport.
<Callout warning>
    Always remember to check in and check out with your OV-chipkaart. If you switch from travelling by train to, say, travelling by bus, remember to check out. This usually does not apply when you switch trains unless you change train companies. If you transfer to a regional train company, you will need to check out as well and then check-in again.
