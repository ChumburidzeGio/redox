# Public Transportation

The Dutch public transport network is clean, efficient, and relatively cheap. The train network covers much of the country. In addition, there is either a tram or a metro system (or both) in larger cities, while smaller cities and towns will have bus links connecting suburbs with central areas.

### Bus
There are both regional and city buses throughout the Netherlands. But long-distance buses are limited to a few connections when there are no train connections. Moreover, the city buses work at night while the other means of transportation are unavailable after midnight.

### Tram
There are trams in Amsterdam, the Hague, Rotterdam and Utrecht, and they run from 6 AM in the morning until midnight.

### Subway (Metro)
Amsterdam and Rotterdam have a metro service. These are usually affordable and generally faster than trams.

### Train
The main public transport in the Netherlands for longer distances is by train. The train network operated by **NS (Nederlandse Spoorwegen)** covers much of the country, but other train companies operate as well.

## The OV-chipkaart
Wherever you are in the Netherlands, it is possible to use the OV-chipkaart for paying in the public transport.

The OV-chipkaart (OV stands for openbaar vervoer, or public transport) is the Dutch smart-card payment system that operates across the country and can be anonymous, personal and business:

**Anonymous cards** can be bought and topped-up from GVB ticket machines and GBV ticket offices at train and metro stations.

**A personal OV-chipkaarts** costs â‚¬ 7,50 and is valid for five years. To buy it, you will need to register online from the OV-chipkaart official website, and you will need to provide a photo for the personal card. You can always charge your personal card online to have sufficient credit on your card. You can also view your travel details through My OV-chip and easily print off a travel expenses overview for your employer. For more information, you can visit the OV-chipkaart [official website](https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/purchase-an-ov-chipkaart/apply-for-personal-ov-chipkaart.htm).

**Business cards** can be requested by your employer, and it is for your office and business trips. And, you won't need to send receipts to your employer manually for work-related trips.

<Callout warning>
    Always remember to check in and check out with your OV-chipkaart. If you switch from travelling by train to, say, travelling by bus, remember to check out. This usually does not apply when you switch trains unless you change train companies. If you transfer to a regional train company, you will need to check out as well and then check-in again.
