# Well-being

Once you are new in the city, it is not easy to find a beauty salon, massage center, hairdresser based on your preferences. However, you can check Google Maps to see reviews and ask your friends for suggestions.

Also, you can use platforms like [Treatwell](https://www.treatwell.nl/) to see the closest ones in your neighborhood, see their ratings, and book appointments online.
