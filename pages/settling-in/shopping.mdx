# Supermarkets and grocery stores

**Albert Heijn** is the most well-known supermarket with good food quality but also the most expensive. **Jumbo and Dirk** are good options for more affordable supermarkets. There are even cheaper alternatives like **Lidl and Aldi** but lower quality. Also, some supermarkets are known for vegan, organic, and gluten-free products, such as **Marqt and Ekoplaza.**

  Some supermarkets, including Albert Heijn, don't accept Visa or Mastercard credit cards. Instead, you'll need cash or a Dutch bank account, which will provide you with a Maestro or V-Pay card that can be used everywhere. And, if you don't want to pay for shopping bags, you should bring your bag from home.

# Online grocery services / food delivery 
If you cannot get to the supermarket in person or prefer home delivery, you can order Albert Heijn and Jumbo or online-only supermarkets such as **Picnic, Groente, and Broer.** 

There are also food delivery platforms like **Thuisbezorgd and UberEats.** You can download their apps, and these platforms will show you the restaurants in your neighborhood. 

# Online shopping stores 
**Zalando, Wehkamp, SNS, Sneaker District, Baskets** are good online clothing stores in the Netherlands. If you need different products such as electronics, clothing, living, etc., from the same store, stores like **Hemma, Bol.com, and Action** might be good options to check.  

When you need furniture for your new apartment, you can check **IKEA**. It is cheap and of good quality. There are also some second-hand shops like **Marktplaats**, which many Dutch people use. 

<Callout warning>
  Always google online shops you will order to check if it is safe and keep in mind looking for the legitimacy of their website before buying something.
