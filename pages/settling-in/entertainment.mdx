## Museums
If you live in Amsterdam, you should visit museums as well. There’s no shortage of museums to go to in Amsterdam. For example, if you go to **Museumplein**, you can visit Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh Museum, Mocco. Although it is hard to find a spot, you can also try Anne Frank House. 

We also recommend modern museums such as [Nxt](https://nxtmuseum.com/), [Eye Filmmuseum](https://www.eyefilm.nl/en), and [Nemo Science Museum](https://www.nemosciencemuseum.nl/en/). They have a different approach to art, cinema, and science than traditional ones and are more interactive and fun.

**The NDSM area** is also something to discover if you like street art. The area hosts many festivals, performances, exhibitions, dance parties and a wide range of other events in post-industrial surroundings.

You should also definitely try **the Museum Nacht Amsterdam (Museum night)**. It usually takes place in November, and with one ticket, you can visit 50 different museums in one night. You will find all exhibits open as usual with live music, DJs, food and drink, and special events.
