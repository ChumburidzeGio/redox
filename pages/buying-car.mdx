# Buying car
Once you settle in the Netherlands, you might want to buy your car. If you are unfamiliar with the practical aspects of car ownership, to help you, here’s our guide to buying a car in the Netherlands.

One of the first decisions to make is buying a new or used car. Of course, each has pros and cons, which can all depend on things like your financial situation and how much you plan to use the car.

## New Car
Naturally, buying a new car is more costly than using a second-hand car. Also, the first owner of a new car must pay a one-off ‘private vehicle and motorcycle tax’ known as **BPM** (Bijzondere Verbruiksbelasting van Personenauto’s) to register the car in their name. That makes a new car more expensive in the Netherlands. 

On the other hand, although costly, you’ll at least know what you’re getting with a new car. Everything from safety features to technology and maintenance checks will be up-to-date. 

While heading out to official dealerships is still an option, more and more people are looking to buy a car online in the Netherlands. For example, at **Bynco**, new vehicles are available at fixed prices. They also help you throughout the process, such as inspection, registration, etc. You can also check a website [Broekhuis](https://broekhuis.nl/) and choose a car brand, price range to see your options. 

## Second-hand Car
If you decide to buy a second-hand car, you should consider the car's history, such as previous ownership and usage. The RDW offers a [license plate check](https://ovi.rdw.nl/) to look up the car history, where they list all details of the car, like previous owners.

  You should always request an inspection test from the seller, and if the previous inspection test is “lost” or was a long time ago, you can feel free to ask for a new one.

There are many places to pick up a used car in the Netherlands, from dealerships to online marketplaces. However, [Marktplaats](https://www.marktplaats.nl/), [Bynco](https://bynco.com/nl-en/expats/?utm_source=Expatica&utm_medium=article-buycarnetherlands) and [Wijkopenautos](https://www.wikoau.nl/waarde/10-18/?MID=NL_NET_4_333504_1547724_0_0_0&net=NL_4&name=513expati) the most known ones. 

**Things to consider:**

- **Registration**: You must register your car when you buy a car in the Netherlands. [The RDW](https://www.rdw.nl/) (Rijksdienst voor het Wegverkeer), the national authority for road traffic, does this. They will give you a credit card-shaped vehicle registration certificate (kentekenbewijs).

- **Road tax**: After registering your car, you will receive a bill for road tax. The amount depends on the type of car you have and which city you live in. You can pre-calculate the costs for the road tax on the [tax authority's website](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/nl/auto-en-vervoer/content/hulpmiddel-motorrijtuigenbelasting-berekenen). 

- **Insurance:** By law, you need to have insurance for your in the Netherlands. It covers you against any damage or injury to others caused by your vehicle. Some car insurance companies are **Centraal Beheer, FBTO, ANWB and ABN-AMRO**. You can compare Dutch car insurance policies using comparison websites like [Pricewise](https://www.pricewise.nl/?actioncode=tradetracker&campagne=regulier&chnid=9d955fb4-af6f-4c5d-9681-21d71325053d) and [Independer](https://www.independer.nl/autoverzekering/info/affiliate/awin?refer=m4nauto&utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=awin_auto&utm_campaign=666995&awc=8599_1644910954_e72e0e0d1c3f2a5c38dc908a9455f19c). 

- **Inspection:** Once you have your car, you must get it periodically inspected by an RDW-approved professional, testing station. This test, called an [APK](https://business.gov.nl/regulation/periodic-motor-vehicle-test-apk/), is comprehensive and not expensive. How often you need to get an APK depends on several factors, such as the type of car you are driving and how many years it has been on the road. However, usually, the test needs to be performed every year or every two years. 

- **Parking:** If you live in a big city, you’ll need a [parking permit](https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/parking/apply-resident-parking-permit/), and there may even be a waiting list.
