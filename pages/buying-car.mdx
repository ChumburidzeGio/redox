# Buying car
Once you settle in the Netherlands, you might want to buy your car. If you are unfamiliar with the practical aspects of car ownership, to help you, here’s our guide to buying a car in the Netherlands.

Whether you want to buy a second-hand car or a new car depends on your own situation and priorities. 

## New Car

The first owner of a new car must pay the **BPM tax** (Bijzondere Verbruiksbelasting van Personenauto’s) to register the vehicle in their name. That makes a new car more expensive in the Netherlands.

**Things to consider:**

- **Registration**: You must register your car when you buy a car in the Netherlands. [The RDW](https://www.rdw.nl/) (Rijksdienst voor het Wegverkeer), the national authority for road traffic, does this. They will give you a credit card-shaped vehicle registration certificate (kentekenbewijs).

- **Road tax**: After registering your car, you will receive a bill for road tax. The amount depends on the type of car you have and which city you live in. You can pre-calculate the costs for the road tax on the [tax authority's website](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/nl/auto-en-vervoer/content/hulpmiddel-motorrijtuigenbelasting-berekenen). 

- **Insurance:** By law, you need to have insurance for your in the Netherlands. It covers you against any damage or injury to others caused by your vehicle. Some car insurance companies are **Centraal Beheer, FBTO, ANWB and ABN-AMRO**. You can compare Dutch car insurance policies using comparison websites like [Pricewise](https://www.pricewise.nl/?actioncode=tradetracker&campagne=regulier&chnid=9d955fb4-af6f-4c5d-9681-21d71325053d) and [Independer](https://www.independer.nl/autoverzekering/info/affiliate/awin?refer=m4nauto&utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=awin_auto&utm_campaign=666995&awc=8599_1644910954_e72e0e0d1c3f2a5c38dc908a9455f19c). 

- **Inspection:** Once you have your car, you must get it periodically inspected by an RDW-approved professional, testing station. This test, called an [APK](https://business.gov.nl/regulation/periodic-motor-vehicle-test-apk/), is comprehensive and not expensive. How often you need to get an APK depends on several factors, such as the type of car you are driving and how many years it has been on the road. However, usually, the test needs to be performed every year or every two years. 

- **Parking:** If you live in a big city, you’ll need a [parking permit](https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/parking/apply-resident-parking-permit/), and there may even be a waiting list.
