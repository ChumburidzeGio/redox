# Schooling
The Dutch school system's structure is different from other countries, so your kids can find it tough to adjust to the school system in the Netherlands.

We help you to make the transition as easy as possible for your children when it comes to finding a suitable school in the Netherlands for them. 

**Searching**:

- **A Dutch or International school**: It is important to decide if you want your kids to go to a Dutch or international school. (If you are going to stay long in the country, ages of your kids, curriculum, etc.) 

- **City/Neighborhood**: Where you would like to live is also essential because some schools might not have spots for your children at the time of your relocation.

- **Newcomers' class**: Depending on your kids' age, they might have to go to newcomers' class to learn the Dutch language before they can continue in Dutch schools. There are no additional costs for attending a newcomers' class. You can check [this website](https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/living/settling-in/family-and-education/primary-school/newcomers-classes-for-primary-school-children) to see which schools are available in your neighborhood.

Once we learn about your expectations and preferences, we will contact schools. The schools usually send their intake forms to parents before enrolling the children. While you sign these forms, you also need to state your address in the Netherlands.

We hand the forms you filled to the schools and schedule digital meetings with them so you can ask all your questions regarding their education system. 

If the schools have available spots in your children's age groups, your children can enroll the schools after all the meetings, and administrative procedures are completed. 

## The Dutch school system

Education is compulsory (leerplicht) in the Netherlands from the ages of five to 16, however, most children start to attend primary school at age four and they transfer to secondary school after eight years.

**Before School**

Until the age of five, infants and young children in the Netherlands can attend a variety of non-compulsory daycare educational options such as crèche, kindergarten or childminding.

**Primary Schools**

Primary school (basisonderwijs) has eight grades, ranging from **Groep 1** (4-year olds) to **Groep 8** (12-year olds). It is not compulsory to attend primary school until Groep 2, at age five, but most children begin in Groep 1 already at the age of four.

Students attend primary school, where they gain basic skills such as reading, writing and arithmetic. 

- **Ages 4 and 5:** The children in this year are called kleuters, and the focus is on learning through play, social skills, structure, and gradual preparation for reading and writing.
- **Ages 6 to 12:** Formal reading and writing start from age 6. They will also start studying English by the time they reach Group 7, if not before then. Most primary schools do not focus heavily on homework (a maximum of 30 minutes per week is assigned on average).  

International children under the age of 6 can go straight into Dutch primary education even if they don't speak Dutch. However, children between six and 12 years old who are new to the Netherlands and don't speak Dutch join newcomers' classes. These schools are called **Taalcentrum/Taalklas** and focus on learning Dutch and acquaint the children with Dutch culture to continue in regular Dutch or bilingual education after one year. 

**Secondary Schools** 

When they start secondary school (middelbare school) at age 12, children enter three different streams for their secondary education. The different streams represent different educational paths based on a student’s academic level and interests. 

Children aged 12 and above go to an international bridging class called **Internationale Schakelklas (ISK).** Students stay in the ISK for approximately one or two years, and the school will test them so they can start at the appropriate level of secondary school. 

- **VMBO (preparatory secondary vocational education):** The VMBO is a four-year vocationally-orientated stream focussed on practical knowledge, which leads to vocational training (MBO). It has two qualification levels and students complete the track at the age of 16.

- **HAVO (senior general secondary education):** The HAVO is a five-year middle stream that prepares students to study higher professional education at universities of applied sciences (hogescholen), where they can follow a bachelor’s degree in applied sciences (HBO). Students complete the HAVO around the age of 17.

- **VWO (pre-university education):** The VWO is a six-year education stream with a focus on theoretical knowledge, that prepares students to follow a bachelor’s degree (WO) at a research university. Students study the VWO at schools known as atheneum and gymnasium and complete the stream around the age of 18.

You can visit the ‘Scholen op de Kaart’ website [www.scholenopdekaart.nl](https://scholenopdekaart.nl/) and enter your postcode to see a list of schools in your area and tick **‘basisschool’** for primary and **‘middelbare school’** for secondary schools.

## International Schools
Many international schools offer an international curriculum at primary and/or secondary levels. Some are subsidised by the government, and others are private. 

All international schools can explain their education options in person, by phone, or online, and they recommend visiting where possible so that you can get a complete sense of their facilities and offerings. 

Some international schools in Amsterdam are **Amity International School, Amsterdam International Community School, British School of Amsterdam** and **Int'l School of Amsterdam.** There are also international schools in Amstelveen and Almere such as **Amstelland International School, International school Almere, and Int'l Primary School Almere.**
