  Before going into details, keep in mind that children attend primary school from four before transferring to secondary school after eight years. The choice of secondary school and type of education determines children’s higher education, for example, whether they will attend a university of applied sciences or a research university.

## Primary Schools 
First, you should look for primary schools in your area by visiting the ‘Scholen op de Kaart’ website [www.scholenopdekaart.nl](www.scholenopdekaart.nl). The primary schools are listed by distance from your home and mention school details like educational approach. You can enter your postcode to see a list of schools in your area. You should tick **‘basisschool’** for primary and **‘middelbare school’** for secondary schools. 

-Most Dutch primary schools combine groups 1 and 2 (ages 4 and 5) in one year. The children in this year are called kleuters, and the focus is on learning through play, social skills, structure, and gradual preparation for reading and writing. 

-Formal reading and writing start in group 3 (from age 6). Most primary schools do not focus heavily on homework (a maximum of 30 minutes per week is assigned on average). Children attend primary school for **eight years.** After group 8 (ages 11 and 12), they move to secondary school. 

## Secondary Schools 
There are different types of Dutch secondary education: 

**VMBO:** preparatory secondary vocational education (four years), followed by MBO (secondary vocational education)

**HAVO:** senior general secondary education (five years), followed by HBO (university of applied sciences)

**VWO:** pre-university education (six years), followed by a research university.

  Many secondary schools offer a mixed-level ‘bridge class’ first year. Then, after obtaining a diploma for a lower level, a student may proceed to the next, higher level if their grades are good enough.
