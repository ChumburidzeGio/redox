# Dutch Schools  

<Callout>
  Before going into details, keep in mind that children attend primary school from four before transferring to secondary school after eight years. The choice of secondary school and type of education determines children’s higher education, for example, whether they will attend a university of applied sciences or a research university.

## Primary Schools 
The primary schools are listed by distance from your home and mention school details like educational approach. You should visit the ‘Scholen op de Kaart’ website [www.scholenopdekaart.nl](www.scholenopdekaart.nl) and enter your postcode to see a list of schools in your area. You should tick **‘basisschool’** for primary and **‘middelbare school’** for secondary schools. 

**Ages 4 and 5:** The children in this year are called kleuters, and the focus is on learning through play, social skills, structure, and gradual preparation for reading and writing. 

International children can generally enroll in a Dutch school at this age group even if they don’t speak Dutch. 

**Ages 6 to 12:** Formal reading and writing start from age 6. Most primary schools do not focus heavily on homework (a maximum of 30 minutes per week is assigned on average).  T

For international students, there are so-called newcomers’ classes available at many Dutch primary schools for ages 6 to 12. They cater for students who have just arrived in the country and don’t speak any Dutch yet. To attend the newcomers’ classes, the child should be speaking a little to no Dutch and has been in the Netherlands for less than one year. 

Children spend approximately one year in the newcomers’ class. After this, they join their local Dutch school, usually attending the same class as other children of their age. 
## Secondary Schools 
There are different types of Dutch secondary education: 

**VMBO:** preparatory secondary vocational education (four years), followed by MBO (secondary vocational education)

**HAVO:** senior general secondary education (five years), followed by HBO (university of applied sciences)

**VWO:** pre-university education (six years), followed by a research university. 

From the age of 12, children who are new to the Netherlands and don’t speak Dutch are placed in an **Internationale Schakelklas (ISK).** After enrolment, the child will be tested by the school so they can start out at the appropriate level. Students stay in the ISK for approximately one or two years and can enrol at any time of the year, but must be present for enrolment. You should contact the school to make an appointment.
# International Schools 
Many international schools in and around the Amsterdam Area offer an international curriculum at primary and/or secondary levels. Some are subsidised by the government, and others are private. 

All international schools can explain their education options in person, by phone, or online, and they recommend visiting where possible so that you can get a complete sense of their facilities and offerings. Some international schools in Amsterdam are **Amity International School, Amsterdam International Community School, British School of Amsterdam** and **Int'l School of Amsterdam.**

  Be sure to read their entry requirements carefully. For example, some schools' entry often requires that at least one parent holds a foreign passport.
