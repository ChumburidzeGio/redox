# Obtaining a driver licence
As an international resident in the Netherlands, you can use your own driving licence for a certain period of time, after which you will be required to obtain a Dutch permit (rijbewijs):

For EU/EFTA countries, licences are valid for ten years from the date of issue (those licences issued after 19 January 2013 are valid for 15 years). For all other countries (including the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba) licences are valid for six months from the date you register at your local municipality.
# Exchange your driver licence 
You can exchange your licence for a Dutch one if you meet ALL of the following conditions:

-You live in the Netherlands and are registered with your local municipality.

-You are from the EU/EEA, Switzerland OR are from a country with a special agreement OR you receive the 30% tax ruling.

-You have a valid residence permit (unless you are a citizen of the EU, EEA or Switzerland).

-Your current driving licence is valid.

-Your current driving licence, if issued in a country outside the EU, was issued after being a resident of that country for at least 185 days.

If you meet the above conditions for exchanging your driving licence, you must submit your application at your local City Office (stadsloket) with **colour passport photograph, your foreign driving licence, your residence permit unless you are a citizen of the EU/EEA or Switzerland, proof of 30% tax ruling (if applicable) and certificate of fitness.**

  If you do not meet these conditions, you cannot directly exchange your licence for a Dutch one. This means you will need to take a standard theory and practical test at the Central Office for Motor Vehicle Driver Testing (CBR).
