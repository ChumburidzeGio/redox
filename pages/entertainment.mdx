## Museums
If you live in Amsterdam, you should visit museums as well. There’s no shortage of museums to go to in Amsterdam. For example, if you go to Museumplein you can visit Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh Museum, Mocco. Although it is hard to find a spot, you can also try Anne Frank House. 

We recommend different museums like Nxt, Eye Museum, and Nemo Science Museum rather than traditional ones. These museums have a modern approach to art, cinema, and science and you always enjoy your time while you are there. 

The NDSM area is also something to discover if you like street art. The area hosts many festivals, performances, exhibitions, dance parties and a wide range of other events in post-industrial surroundings.

You should also definitely try the Museum Nacht Amsterdam(Museum night). It usually takes place in November, and with one ticket, you can visit 50 different museums in one night. You will find all exhibits open as usual with live music, DJs, food and drink, and special events.
