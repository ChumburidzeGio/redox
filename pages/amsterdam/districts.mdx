# Amsterdam Districts

The Amsterdam Area encompasses the city of Amsterdam and 32 of its surrounding
municipalities. Amsterdam is broken up into 8 districts or boroughs (stadsdelen), which are further divided into neighborhoods.

### Centre
This area around Dam Square and Nieuwmarkt, and through the neighborhood known as De Wallen (Red Light District), is the oldest part of the city.

### Jordaan
Tightly packed streets and canals west of the city center. Once a neighborhood for the working class and emigrants, nowadays almost completely renovated and very popular among artists, students, professionals, young entrepreneurs, and tourists.

### De Pijp
One of the most cosmopolitan and vibrant districts of Amsterdam with fantastic caf√©s, restaurants, shops, and the daily Albert Cuyp street market.

### Oud-Zuid
More expensive than De Pijp and one of the most desirable residential neighborhood with the city's most fashionable shopping streets PC Hooftstraat, Van Baerlestraat and Beethovenstraat, famous museums (Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, Stedelijk Museum), Coster Diamonds, Concertgebouw, and the Vondelpark.

### Noord
Across the water from Centraal Station is Amsterdam-Noord (Amsterdam North), a district that has been little more than a dull dormitory suburb up until now. This is changing, though, with dining and entertainment venues opening up.
