# About us
Relocify is a no-bullshit relocation service for people-centric companies. We focus on speed and practicality and ensure your success and happiness in the most efficient and cost-effective manner possible.

We started in 2020 during the pandemic with the simple idea of doing apartment viewings remotely with video calls and completing most of the process before persons' arrival to the country. Most companies were hiring internationally and relocating people, but finding an apartment before employees' arrival was vital due to many covid-related restrictions and extra costs related to temporary housing. So in the next few months, we also developed software to analyze the rental market and automate the process to drive the price down and offer our service to as many people and companies as possible.

### Our mission
We want to bring fast, all-inclusive relocation services to engineers, designers, and data scientists in the European tech hubs.

The precious time you would spend dealing with the stressful process of moving to a new place, we shall free you to engage in what is crucial for you and your work.

Our goal is to replace eventual negative experiences with positive ones so that you can start your job as early as possible, be happy with your life changes, and deliver fantastic performance in the new workplace.
