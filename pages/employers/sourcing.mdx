# Sourcing

Hiring the right talent is of paramount importance for nearly every company. According to the 2020 [PwC report](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/managing-tomorrows-people/future-of-work/pdf/talent-mobility-2020.pdf), 97% of CEOs identify it as a top priority for business growth.

According to the [research](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/guide-ctos-dutch-market-2021-european-tech-hub-gerbert-oude-velthuis/) conducted by ABN Amro, 55% of the companies are hampered in their growth by the lack of skilled IT staff.

Fortunately, talent acquisition is no longer limited by geographic boundaries. Most companies start looking for talented people in the EU but even this market isnâ€™t big enough in many cases. What we see is that most companies start recruiting in the world in the end, without limits.

To hire internationally there are a few things that you have to consider while sourcing potential candidates.

## Write Clear Job Description
In addition to the usual [best practices for writing job description](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360003565931-Best-practices-Write-an-effective-job-description), there are other things to consider:

- Clearly indicate that the position is open to international candidates
- Summarise benefits that you offer, explain whatâ€™s included in your relocation support package; as well as general employee benefits and try to make them clear for internationals what you mean (Swapfiets subscription â†’ [Bike subscription](https://swapfiets.nl/en))
- Avoid the commonly used Dutch terms and abbreviations in job descriptions, such as collective labour agreement, local names for the types of contracts or Dutch terms used in educational system (WO, MBOâ€¦)
- Emphasise key skills and qualifications more so than educational requirements, as these vary from country to country
- Give stats about diversity and inclusion in your company such as % of employees that are expats, people from how many nationalities work in the company and gender diversity.
- Link to your companyâ€™s social media accounts, blog and other employer branding channels that convey your company culture

### Manage expectations

Inform what they can expect in the Netherlands when itâ€™s about culture and living conditions.

Give insight into the costs of living, and tell which costs your organization bears and which the candidate. These concern travel, accommodation, relocation and costs for the necessary documents and permits.

Also, for workers from non EU/EEA countries clearly describe what the immigration process will be like and how long the process will take.

## Publish on Job Boards

Obviously N1 place for sourcing candidates thatâ€™s LinkedIn, either by published the job there or manually sourcing candidates in specific geographies via the LinkedIn Recruiter.

International job boards such as [Indeed](https://indeed.com/), [Angel.co](https://angel.co/), [Relocate.me](https://relocate.me/employer) or [Landing.jobs](https://landing.jobs/employers/) work pretty well for many companies.

Also, consider using services such as [Join.com](http://Join.com) for multiposting jobs on platforms mentioned above at the same time.

**Local Job Boards**

By publishing only on international job boards you will miss on 50-60% of potential candidates at least, especially when itâ€™s about Senior tech talent with 6+ years of experience. Here are a few local job boards by country:

- ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Ukraine: [Dou](https://jobs.dou.ua/) is for all types of tech jobs, from junior to senior levels and [Djini](https://djinni.co/) is mainly used to recruit more senior talent
- ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± Poland: best place for recruiting tech talent itâ€™s [JustJoin.it](https://justjoin.it/) and for marketing/sales related roles [RocketJobs](https://rocketjobs.pl/)
- *We will be adding more local job boards in the future*

**Communities**

Apart from job boards and manually sourcing on the LinkedIn you can join [Slack channels](https://toggl.com/blog/candidate-sourcing) for specific technologies and jobs and post there.
