# Integration

Starting over in a new country can be a challenge or an opportunity. An opportunity to learn, explore, and experience a great international environment. There are countless ways of helping expats settle in a new country they will soon call home.

## Buddy Program
A buddy program is more than an onboarding and training method. It allows employees to create stronger bonds and develop themselves professionally and personally.

Allowing current employees to train new employees will enable them to broaden their knowledge and improve their communication and training skills. Similarly, this helps expats adapt to the working environment and learn the local culture and environment.

## Language
Most of the time, language is not a barrier at work in the Netherlands, but it's frequently a big problem in the case of socialization.

As finding new friends in the new country is the #1 problem for expats, offering language courses will massively improve their chances of meeting locals and socializing outside the "expat bubble."
