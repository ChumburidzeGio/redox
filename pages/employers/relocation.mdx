# Relocation

Moving to a new country is a big decision and hard for anyone.

For our partner companies, mentioning the relocation service in job descriptions usually doubles or triples the number of top candidates applying for the job.

Employees who start searching for an apartment on their own generally end up living in the hotel for 2-3 months while paying at least €2k per month. They feel stressed, and moving to a new country/starting a new job becomes a painful experience instead of excitement.

## Timeline
It's best to invite your employee as early as possible, so we have enough time to find the long-term home before their arrival so when they come to Amsterdam, from the first day on they can live in their new home.

Generally, we need 2-3 weeks to find the property, but many things can prolong the process; for example, having pets usually increases the time by half or even doubles sometimes, depending on the pet's size.

## BSN Appointments and Delays
Due to work overload in the municipality and IN Amsterdam, newcomers usually need a month after arrival to get the BSN. Therefore, we generally try to swap timeslots between our clients in case of urgency or check daily for cancelations with IN Amsterdam.

Without BSN, your employee won't be able to get the salary and the health insurance, but there are solutions:

- Salary can be paid without BSN using [het anoniementarief](https://www.administratie-informatie.nl/anoniementarief), they will receive a bit lower salary, but the difference will be reimbursed at the end of the year.
- Before getting the insurance, the employee will have to cover all medical expenses from their pocket, but they should keep all bills, and the insurance company will then reimburse all the costs from the first day of arrival.

## First Month Fixed Costs
In the first month for the apartment, they will have to pay on top of the rent the deposit, which is always 2x month's rent, so if the rent is €1500, in the first month, they will have to pay €4,500.

In some situations, an employee can't transfer the first month's rent and the deposit on time, so we pay on their behalf, and then they pay us.

On top of the rent + deposit, they usually have to pay to IN Amsterdam for BSN registration. [Currently](https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/our-network/in-amsterdam/about/our-services/fees), it's €62 for high skilled migrants and €32 for partners.
