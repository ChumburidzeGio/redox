# 30% Ruling
The 30% ruling is a Dutch personal tax privilege for certain employees who have been posted or recruited from abroad to work in the Netherlands.

The most important benefit of the 30% ruling is that employers may grant to their employees a maximum tax-free allowance of 30% of the (original) agreed income from current employment without proof of (actual) costs. This may reduce the maximum Dutch tax rate on employment income from 51,75% to 36,23%.

There are a number of conditions to be fulfilled and timing of concluding the employment agreement and arriving in the Netherlands is crucial. If you do it wrong, you may jeopardize eligibility.

The 30% ruling is granted for a maximum period of 60 months (5 years). For employments that started before January 1, 2012 the maximum duration period is 10 years.

## Conditions

Below you find a summary of the most important conditions of the 30% ruling but it always makes sense to check eligibility with your advisor even if you have little or no doubt.

#### Employee must be from abroad
30% ruling is for employees recruited from foreign countries who have lived more than 150 km from the Dutch borders in at least 16 of the 24 months prior the employment in the Netherlands.

#### Specific expertise

Employee must have specific expertise and must meet certain salary norms. For regular employees, this salary norm is € 39,647 (2022) (not including the tax free allowance).

Special salary norms apply for certain employees younger than 30 with a MSc title or scientific personnel, researchers and medical staff.

#### Contractual agreement

This is one of the conditions of the 30% ruling that is often overseen. The 30% ruling must be contractually agreed upon separately from the salary between employer and employee. Generally, the so-called [cost-neutral method](https://www.ttt-group.com/knowledge-base/conditions-of-the-30-ruling/#contractual%20agreement) is chosen.

## Application for the 30% ruling

In order to obtain the ruling, an application form must be filed by the employer and employee within the first 4 months of employment and sent to the Dutch tax authorities.

If done later than 4 months the benefit can not be enjoyed from the first day of employment and will be granted as per the first day of the month following the month in which the application has been filed so no retroactive effect.
