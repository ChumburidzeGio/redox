# Immigration

Immigration, visas, and sponsorships can seem quite confusing due to the vast amount of information available. Here you will find all the essential information about immigration and international hiring matters, including visa sponsorships and tax perks.

## Recognised sponsorship

One of the requirements for the highly skilled migrant procedure is that your company holds a recognised sponsorship with the [IND](http://www.ind.nl/) (Dutch Immigration Authorities) and added to the [Public Register](https://ind.nl/en/Pages/public-register-recognised-sponsors.aspx) for Recognised Sponsors.

If your own company is not (yet) a recognised sponsor you can opt to work with an employer of record (payroll/umbrella companies). In this case, this is the formal employer of your new employee. After a successful application your employee can change employer so that she/he is on contract with your company itself.

Becoming a recognised sponsor by the IND is a simple process, and if everything goes smoothly, you could have a decision even within two weeks after applying. As it happens with other types of applications, there is a set of criteria and requirements for employers. You can find a [list of the requirements](https://ind.nl/en/general-conditions-for-recognised-sponsors) on the IND official website.

If your company meets the requirements, you are ready to apply. Download the [application form](https://ind.nl/en/Forms/7501.pdf) and gather all the information required to apply; this is listed on the form. Once the application is filled out and the documents ready, send them both together via post to the IND.

You now need to pay the application fee. Upon receipt of the fee, the IND will make a decision based on the information provided within two to twelve weeks, and you will receive a final decision as either approved or rejected.

When you find your global talent, you need to start the Entry and Residence Procedure (TEV) with the IND.
