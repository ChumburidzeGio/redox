# Health insurance
Everyone who lives or works in the Netherlands is legally obliged to take out standard health insurance. When you move to the Netherlands you have 4 months to get insurance and you are covered retroactively as well as pay from the first day of arrival. 

You are free to choose from any health insurer but it is easier to find a company that offers information in English, as many have Dutch-only websites. 

You can also change insurers once a year by canceling your previous insurer before 1 January and taking out new insurance before 1 February. You will then be covered with your new provider with retroactive effect from 1 January. If you sign up to a new insurer before this date, they can also cancel your current policy on your behalf. To register for health insurance, you need to have your BSN.

## Own Risk (Eigen Risico)
You should keep in mind that there are two main costs that you need to pay for your Dutch health insurance.

**The monthly premium**: It is a fixed fee deducted from your bank account each month. Children under the age of 18 must have health insurance but do not pay any premiums for the standard package. Parents must register their child with an insurance company within four months of their birth. 

**The "own risk" amount (eigen risico)**: Eigen risico is the maximum amount of costs you have to pay per year for healthcare products and services (covered by this insurance) that you use that year. In 2022, eigen risico is set at 385 euros but you can voluntarily increase this level to a total of € 885. The higher the deductible you choose, the lower your premium will be. When you’re willing to pay more up front when you need care, you save on what you pay each month.

**Costs that are covered (you do not pay "eigen risico")** (The government decides on the coverage of the standard package, so all insurers offer the same standard package)

- Consultations at your General Practitioner’s office

- Costs for maternity care

- Costs for nursing care

- Loans of medical equipment

- Certain care for some chronic diseases like diabetes type 2

- Follow-up check-ups for organ donation and travel costs for organ donation

- All care for children younger than 18 years, including the Dental Care Package.

**Additional Insurance** 
There are health care services are covered by the standard package. However, you can opt to take out additional insurance to cover, for example, physiotherapy or dental care. Do bear in mind that if you do not need physiotherapy or dental care regularly, buying an extra package can increase your *monthly premium* significantly.  

You check the video below to see how the "monthly premium" and "own risk" work.

To select your insurance provider, you can check [Independer](https://www.independer.nl/zorgverzekering/intro.aspx). You will need to provide your date of birth, gender, postal code, and if you want to include family members in insurance. Then you can choose your "own" risk and decide if you will have any additional treatments. Mainly the difference between health providers is which hospitals and doctors they cover. However, most insurance companies cover all the hospitals in Amsterdam, so you only need to compare the prices. 

## Finding GP
General practitioners (huisarts) play an essential role in the Dutch healthcare system; they are the first port of call if you have health problems. If necessary, your GP will refer you to a specialist at a hospital. You are free to choose your doctor. However, it is helpful to choose one close to home.  

You could use websites like [Zorgkaart](https://www.zorgkaartnederland.nl/) to compare different GPs in your area and pick the one that best fits your needs. Customer service of insurance providers will also help you find a GP near you or ask us, and we will try to help you with the search.
