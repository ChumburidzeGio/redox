# How to buy a health insurance?

You are free to select the health insurance provider of your choice. However, it easier to find a company that offers information in English, as many have Dutch-only websites. Some notable expat-friendly health insurance providers include: Zilveren Kruis, ONVZ, United Consumers, FBTO, Univ√© Verzekeringen, VGZ,

There are two main costs that you need to pay for your Dutch health insurance:

The monthly premium (premie), a fixed fee that is deducted from your bank account each month.

The "own risk" amount (eigen risico), which is an annual amount that you must pay out of your own pocket for some treatments and medicines before your health insurance will cover the rest. In 2021, the eigen risico is up to a maximum of 385 euros. If you do not have any medical costs in a year then you pay no eigen risico.
