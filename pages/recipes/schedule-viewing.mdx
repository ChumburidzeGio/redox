# How to schedule apartment viewing?

Generally when sending a request for viewing, include some basic information about yourself such as what you are doing, where you are working, how old are you, and how much is your yearly gross salary. Besides these, it's always good to mention for how long you want to rent, from when and if you are renting for yourself only or with someone, and if you have pets/smoke.

Example of a request:

> Hi, it's John Doe, 24, a software engineer, and I'm interested in this apartment, I will be living with my girlfriend, no pets, no smokers. I'm be working for a Dutch company with a 1-year contract for â‚¬80k gross and want to move in at the beginning of Jan. Please let me know when it's possible to have a viewing. Thanks
