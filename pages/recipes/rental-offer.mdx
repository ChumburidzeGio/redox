# How to send a rental offer?

After the viewing, if you are positive about the apartment, make an offer by sending your full name, profession, email, phone number, home country address, annual salary, passport scan, and employment. Also, include some basic information about yourself, such as what you are doing and your hobbies, making it personal.

You can't make more than one offer at the same time as withdrawing an offer can get you into trouble with the agency.
  
Example of an offer:
  
Hi Just,

Thanks for the viewing on Friday in Some Apartment. I loved the apartment, and I would like to make an offer. I am relocating to the Netherlands from Russia. I will work in Amsterdam for Acme Inc as a software engineer for an indefinite contract with a salary of €85k. Copies of my passport and a scan of the employment contract you can find attached to this email. I will be in NL already on the 5th of October.
