# How to send a rental offer?

After the viewing, if you are positive about the apartment, make an offer by sending your full name, profession, email, phone number, home country address, annual salary, passport scan, and employment. Also, include some basic information about yourself, such as what you are doing and your hobbies, making it personal.

You can't make more than one offer at the same time as withdrawing an offer can get you into trouble with the agency.
