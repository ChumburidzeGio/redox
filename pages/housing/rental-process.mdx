# Rental Process
Relocify takes care of the full process and you won't have to do most of the things mentioned below on your own but to better understand the process and have it for future reference here is the full description.

The rental process generally starts on housing websites such as [Pararius](https://www.pararius.com) for more affordable apartments and [Funda](https://funda.nl) for more upper-end offers. There are also housing corporations publishing apartments exclusively on their websites such as [Holland2Stay](https://www.holland2stay.com).

## Scheduling Viewings
After finding an attractive offer second step is scheduling a viewing which generally can be done from the listing page. After the request is sent it is sometimes worth calling by phone for faster feedback.

If your request goes through you will be invited for a viewing. If you never receive an answer, most probably already a lot of people requested viewing so the agency is focusing on them or already negotiating a contract with a future tenant.

    Due to high competition, it's worth frequently checking housing websites as calling early can significantly increase your chances of viewing an apartment.

Most viewings last 10-15 minutes and are done individually, occasionally there are open houses or viewings where 3-4 people are invited at the same time.

## Sending an Offer
If you like the apartment, after the viewing you will have to send an offer with your contact details and information you sent while booking a viewing, employment contract and passport scans.

<Callout warning>
    You can't make more than one offer at the same time as withdrawing an offer can get you into trouble with the agency.

If the landlord accepts an offer you will receive a draft version of the rental agreement, which can be negotiated and which is generally **type A** or **B**:

#### Type A
Terminable by tenant: yes, per calendar month after the end of the fixed period (usually 1 year). Terminable by the landlord: yes, after the 1st fixed period. But cancellation is difficult and only for good reasons (e.g. the tenant does not pay, tenant causes a nuisance, etc.).

#### Type B
Terminable by tenant: yes, the tenant can cancel during the entire rental period per calendar month. Terminable by landlord: no, the landlord must adhere to the agreed rental period.

<Callout>
    We generally request type B contracts for our clients as it's flexible and tenants can cancel them with one month notice period unless type A contracts are with a diplomatic clause.

## Deposit

With the first month's rent, you are also required to pay a deposit (Borg in Dutch) which is typically two months'rent for both furnished and unfurnished apartments. 

When your rental contract ends and if you leave the property in good condition, the landlord has to return a deposit within a month.
## Check in
After the owner accepts a tenant and the contract is fully signed, we schedule the check-in. During the check-in, an inventory list and an inspection report are made.

Usually, the agency or/and the landlord would be present with you and us during the inspection. The inspection report clarifies any damage to the rented accommodation and items at the check-in and check-out. 

If you discover damages after the check-in, you can still add them to the inspection report, but you should inform the landlord as soon as possible. You can also take pictures and make them added to the inspection report.
