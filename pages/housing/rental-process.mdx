# Rental Process
Relocify takes care of the full process and you won't have to do most of the things mentioned below on your own but to better understand the process and have it for future reference here is the full description.

The rental process generally starts on housing websites such as [Pararius](https://www.pararius.com) for more affordable apartments and [Funda](https://funda.nl) for more upper-end offers. There are also housing corporations publishing apartments exclusively on their websites such as [Holland2Stay](https://www.holland2stay.com).

## Scheduling Viewings

After finding an attractive offer second step is scheduling a viewing which generally can be done from the listing page. After the request is sent it is sometimes worth calling by phone for faster feedback.

If your request goes through you will be invited for a viewing. If you never receive an answer, most probably already a lot of people requested viewing so the agency is focusing on them or already negotiating a contract with a future tenant.

    Due to high competition, it's worth frequently checking housing websites as calling early can significantly increase your chances of viewing an apartment.

Most viewings last 10-15 minutes and are done individually, occasionally there are open houses or viewings where 3-4 people are invited at the same time.

## Sending an Offer
If you like the apartment, after the viewing you will have to send an offer with your contact details and information you sent while booking a viewing, employment contract and passport scans.

    You can't make more than one offer at the same time as withdrawing an offer can get you into trouble with the agency.

If the landlord accepts an offer you will receive a draft version of the rental agreement, which can be negotiated and which is generally **type A** or **B**:

#### Type A
Terminable by tenant: yes, per calendar month after the end of the fixed period (usually 1 year). Terminable by the landlord: yes, after the 1st fixed period. But cancellation is difficult and only for good reasons (e.g. the tenant does not pay, tenant causes a nuisance, etc.).

#### Type B
Terminable by tenant: yes, the tenant can cancel during the entire rental period per calendar month. Terminable by landlord: no, the landlord must adhere to the agreed rental period.

    We generally request **type B** contracts for our clients as it's flexible and tenants can cancel them with one month notice period unless type A contracts are with a diplomatic clause.

## Deposit

When renting an apartment in the Netherlands, most tenants must pay a deposit of one or two months’ rent as rental security. Generally, tenants pay a one-time deposit if the apartment is unfurnished. 
However, if it is furnished, you are required to pay two times of the rent. When your rental contract ends or when you cancel your rental agreement because you have found a new place, and if you leave the property in good condition, the landlord is required to pay back your rental security deposit. If you have not agreed upon a specific deadline, it is customary for your landlord to return your deposit after one month.
