# Rental Market

If you're planning a short-term stay in the Amsterdam Area (under five years), renting is your best bet. After all, contracts can be easily changed, and you're spared the effort of making major repairs or maintenance.

The Amsterdam rental market is made up of the social housing sector (60%) and the liberated housing sector (40%). The social housing sector is only accessible if you've been living and registered in Amsterdam for at least 10+ years. This leaves the liberated housing sector. Due to this divide, the supply doesn't always match the demand which creates a very dynamic and ever-changing housing market. Apartments can be on the market ranging from 2 working days for the popular low-budget apartments to weeks and sometimes even months for the more high-end ones.

Apartment prices on housing websites are always excluding utilities. The average price for a furnished, one-bedroom apartment is €1,500-€1600 in Amsterdam + 2 months rent as a deposit; unfurnished apartments on average cost €100 or €150 less + 1-month rent as a deposit. This price depends also on location and expect to pay more if you’re in the ring in a nicer area. We generally search for furnished apartments for expats, especially when they move to the Netherlands for the first time.

Some expats look outside of Amsterdam, hoping that prices will be lower but from our experience, it's approximately €100 difference on furnished apartments in Utrecht and Haarlem. Considering commute and transportation costs, it's generally advised to live in Amsterdam if the workplace is located in Amsterdam.
