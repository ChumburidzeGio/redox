# Utilities

In the Netherlands, regional companies are responsible for the transportation of energy (electricity and gas) and it is possible to choose your own energy supplier from comparison websites like [Pricewise](https://www.pricewise.nl/energie-vergelijken/) or [Independer](https://www.independer.nl/energie/info/besparen/energieverbruik-berekenen).

In many cases, the utilities (gas, water, and electricity) will already be available in your apartment, and you only need to set up accounts in your name. 
## Electricity
Things to consider when looking for electricity providers:
For the usage there is "Stroom normal", this is during the day and "Stroom dal", at night. You can check with the landlord how much the previous tenant used or specify 900 for "Stroom normal" for 2 people (on the site the default is 1250 - this is a lot) and 500 for "Stroom dal". If you use more electricity than indicated, you will have to pay extra at the end of the year, if less then the difference will be refunded.

## Water
Although you can choose your energy provider, you cannot choose your water supplier. Each city has its own provider - in Amsterdam, it is Waternet - you can register on [their website](https://www.waternet.nl/en/service-and-contact/moving-home/register/#/)

## Energy Labels
Houses and apartments must have an energy label when they are being built, sold or rented. The owner must hand over the certificate to the tenant. The labels on electrical appliances have been simplified. Energy labels are from A++++ to G, and the cost difference per year is not massive. Ones with A, B labels have double glazing, so you spend less on heating, and the difference per year in Amsterdam on 50-60m2 apartments will be 200-300e approx.
