# Buying property
If you plan on staying in Amsterdam for the long term, it might be wiser to buy a property at a certain point instead of living in a rented apartment. Despite competition in the housing market in Amsterdam, there are long-term benefits to owning your own house. 

This section explains key points of purchasing a property in Amsterdam, such as where to look for houses, financial aspects of it, legal procedures, and helpful tips. 

## Search
You can start checking listing websites such as [Funda](https://www.funda.nl/en/), [Pararius](https://www.pararius.nl/), [Expadica](https://www.expatica.com/nl/housing-listings/). Then, you can deduct some neighborhoods you like with extra filters based on your preferences. Also, you can get some advice from friends and family regarding what neighborhoods are up and coming, are touristic, are safer these days, etc. 

**Things to consider**

- **Property prices**: 

There are significant differences in property prices between different areas of the Netherlands. Property prices have risen sharply in recent years in main cities like Amsterdam due in part to a housing shortage. You can use Funda’s value estimator to estimate how much the property is worth depending on the condition of the place. Also you can check **the Land Registry (kadaster)** for house prices in different areas. 

There will also be additional costs to the price of the property itself, such as transfer tax, mortgage arrangement, estate agent fee(if you have one), and notary costs. These extra costs add up to approximately 5–7% of the purchase price.  It is important to allow for these additional but unavoidable costs when setting your budget.

- **Ground lease**: 

If your apartment stands in the ground that belongs to Amsterdam municipality, you need to pay an annual fee for living in the house. It is wiser to buy an apartment that does not have ground lease. 

- **Real estate agencies** 

You need to decide whether you want to work with a real estate agent or find your place yourself. You can call some agencies to learn the services they could provide. Before calling, you may want to use a real estate comparison platform such as [Juiste Makelaar](https://juistemakelaar.nl/en/?utm_source=expatica&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=guide_buy_home&utm_content=textlink). 

The real estate agents usually help you find a house, bid on a place, how much construction that house needs, etc. Some of them offer a full-service from finding you a house to helping you furnish it. Using a real estate agent costs you approximately 1 to 2% of the purchase price.

- **Financial status**: 

The Netherlands does not place any restrictions on the purchase of property by foreigners, whether resident or non-resident. However, to get a mortgage you must live and be registered in the Netherlands.

Mortgage interest rates are at an all-time low and some banks may offer 100% mortgages. So, for example, if you buy the house at the same price as the evaluation report's price, the bank can lend you 100% of the purchase price. However, if your purchase price was higher than the evaluation report, you will have to pay the difference. 

It is way easier to get a mortgage if you have an employment contract than being a freelancer. Even if you do not have a permanent contract, you can ask your employer to give you an employer statement. It states that they will renew your contract as long as nothing changes.

There are different types of Dutch mortgages, so it is recommended that you get a mortgage advisor to help you find the right choice for your financial situation. This is especially useful if you don’t speak Dutch or are new to the Dutch property market.  

You can also contact a Dutch bank to ask how much mortgage you could get based on your income. You can also check [mortgage calculators](https://expatsamsterdam.com/mortgage-calculator/?utm_source=expatica&utm_campaign=Expatica&utm_medium=directlink&utm_content=NL-100633) to see how much you could get, the mortgage's length, and the price of the repayments.



## Viewings 

Since you will know your price range and what to expect after some research, you can decide which ones you want to go for viewings. If you spot something you like, you can then call the real estate agent or owner listed to make an appointment to see the property. You should react to new offers as soon as possible homes in popular areas go very quickly. 

Viewings take place between business hours (9 am – 5 pm) with an agent, so it can mean taking time off work to visit the property. Most viewings last 10-15 minutes, and if you like an apartment, the agency will tell you when you should send your offer after the viewing.

## Offer 
If you think you find a place you want to live in, you must bid on the house. You are not obliged to offer the asking price. Since the Amsterdam market is very competitive, you will usually need to offer 10-15% above the asking price. 

When you send your offer, you should mention the offer price, if your finances are already pre-approved by the bank, if you want an inspection, and your ideal move-in date.

## Contract 
Once you get the house, as a next step, the real estate agent will tell you whether you need to contact a notary or the landlord will for drafting the purchase agreement.  

The landlord or the real estate agency finds the notary in most cases. However, sometimes, it can be your responsibility. Since Amsterdam has many notaries, it is not hard to find one.

  Keep in mind that if you buy a house in Amsterdam, the notary should be in Amsterdam as well.

It usually takes a week to draft the purchase agreement. After the draft purchase agreement is ready, all parties must sign it. Once you sign the draft purchase agreement, it is a legally binding contract. However, after you sign the draft contract, only as a buyer, you have three days to change your mind without giving any explanation.
