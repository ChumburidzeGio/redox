# Buying property
If you plan on staying in Amsterdam for the long term, it might be wiser to buy a property at a certain point instead of living in a rented apartment. Despite competition in the housing market in Amsterdam, there are long-term benefits to owning your own house. 

This section explains key points of purchasing a property in Amsterdam, such as where to look for houses, financial aspects of it, legal procedures, and helpful tips. 

## Search
You can start checking listing websites like [Funda](https://www.funda.nl/en/). Then, you can deduct some neighborhoods you like with extra filters based on your preferences. Also, you can get some advice from friends and family regarding what neighborhoods are up and coming, are touristic, are safer these days, etc. 

**Things to consider**

- **Property prices**: (more info to here) You can use Fundaâ€™s value estimator to estimate how much the property is worth depending on the condition of the place. 

- **Financial status**: You can contact a Dutch bank to ask how much mortgage you could get based on your income. You can also check mortgage calculator websites to see how much you would get. Once you know your price range, you can start looking for a house. 

(Explanation about financial part such as mortgage, how long it would take to get it, how to make appointment with a notary etc.)

## Viewings 

Since you will know what to expect after some research, you can decide which ones you want to go for viewings. When you find an apartment you like, you should react to new offers as soon as possible because the housing market is very competitive in Amsterdam.

Most viewings last 10-15 minutes, and if you like an apartment, the agency will tell you when you should send your offer after the viewing.

## Offer 
If you think you find a place you want to live in, you must bid on the house. The Amsterdam market is very competitive, so you will usually need to offer 10-15% above the asking price. 

When you send your offer, you should mention the offer price, if your finances are already pre-approved by the bank, if you want an inspection, and your ideal move-in date.

## Contract 
Once you get the house, as a next step, the real estate agent will tell you whether you need to contact a notary or the landlord will for drafting the purchase agreement.  

The landlord or the real estate agency finds the notary in most cases. However, sometimes, it can be your responsibility. Since Amsterdam has many notaries, it is not hard to find one.

It usually takes a week to draft the purchase agreement. After the draft purchase agreement is ready, all parties must sign it. Once you sign the draft purchase agreement, it is a legally binding contract. However, after you sign the draft contract, only as a buyer, you have three days to change your mind without giving any explanation.
