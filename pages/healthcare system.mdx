# Finding GP
General practitioners (huisarts) play an essential role in the Dutch healthcare system; they are the first port of call if you have health problems. If necessary, your GP will refer you to a specialist at a hospital. You are free to choose your doctor. However, it is helpful to choose one close to home.  

You could use websites like [Zorgkaart](https://www.zorgkaartnederland.nl/) to compare different GPs in your area and pick the one that best fits your needs. Customer service of insurance providers will also help you find a GP near you or ask us, and we will help you with the search.
