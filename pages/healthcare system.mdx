# Finding GP
General practitioners (huisarts) play an essential role in the Dutch healthcare system; they are the first port of call if you have health problems. If necessary, your GP will refer you to a specialist at a hospital. You are free to choose your doctor. However, it is helpful to choose one close to home.  

You could use websites like [Zorgkaart](https://www.zorgkaartnederland.nl/) to compare different GPs in your area and pick the one that best fits your needs. Customer service of insurance providers will also help you find a GP near you or ask us, and we will help you with the search. 

# Dental Care
Basic insurance policies do not cover dental care (except for children under 18 and specialist dental care, such as surgery). Supplementary dental insurance can cover the cost (or a percentage of it). Depending on your health insurance, this could cover up to 75 percent of the cost. For the exact coverage, you can check the policy terms or contact your insurer. 

There are many many expat-friendly dental professionals, clinics, and practices around Amsterdam. Dentists list their prices on their website, and insurance companies have comparable lists of how much they will cover for each service, allowing people to choose their level of care. Also, on their websites, you can learn more about their methods and services, locations and opening hours, and book an appointment. 

To find your dentist, you can also ask your friends, neighbours, and your GP or visit [the website Tandarts.nl](https://www.tandarts.nl/tandarts-amsterdam)

On the other hand, dental surgeons are usually affiliated with a hospital, while orthodontists work in private practice. To visit one of these, you will need a referral from a regular dentist. However, there are also dental hygiene practices in larger cities like Amsterdam, which you don't need a referral to visit.
